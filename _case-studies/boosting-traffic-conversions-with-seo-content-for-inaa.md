## Boosting Traffic & Conversions with SEO Content for INAA

### How We Helped INAA Expand Their International Foothold Through High-quality SEO Content

Turning complex, financial topics into digestible, engaging content is easier said than done – especially in a language that’s not your mother tongue.

[INAA](https://www.inaa.org/) (International Association of Accounting and Audit Independent Firms) is a global membership network where finance professionals exchange knowledge, collaborate, and expand their reach.

When INAA, based in Belgium, needed expert English content to strengthen their digital presence, they turned to CopyHouse.

## A Need to Increase Visibility, Engagement & Credibility

Initially, INAA struggled to attract inbound interest from potential members and lacked visibility in the global accounting community. Their internal team had little time to focus on content or SEO, and their written English needed polish.

What began as a simple proofreading brief quickly evolved into a **comprehensive SEO content marketing project** designed to build **credibility, reach, and conversions**.

---

## Strengthening INAA’s Online Position with SEO Content

We began with a detailed strategy session to map out INAA’s goals. They needed:

- A robust **SEO plan** to guide content
- An engaging **tone of voice** tailored to international readers
- Regular **thought leadership articles** that would live on their website

Our SEO specialists created a strategic roadmap that included:

- Target keyword research
- Content pillars and calendars
- Long-form article topics to drive traffic and engagement

## Helping INAA Withstand COVID-19 with Engaging Content

As the world entered lockdown in 2020, INAA stayed the course — continuing to publish valuable, informative content.

> “If we didn’t have CopyHouse, it would have been more difficult to stay in touch with our membership and continue to offer professional material.”  
> — *Nadège Mullier, Executive Manager at INAA*

Our continued support helped INAA maintain visibility and connection during a time when communication was more important than ever.

## Increased Conversion Rates & Audience Engagement

Thanks to close collaboration and ongoing content refinement, INAA saw:

- Increased **organic traffic**
- Better **conversion rates**
- Higher engagement across platforms like LinkedIn

Our ability to transform **technical, jargon-heavy financial content** into **engaging, accessible writing** helped build trust and authority across global audiences.

> “It’s so much more than what I could have thought a copywriter can do.”  
> — *Nadège Mullier*
