## Building Long-term Momentum with INAA

Modern businesses have a wide variety of options when it comes to digital marketing strategies, but **content marketing** remains one of the most effective tools for building **long-term, high-impact results**.

We partnered with [INAA](https://www.inaa.org/), an international association of accountancy firms with 140 members across 50 countries, to help them harness the power of **SEO**, share **expert industry insights**, and **boost member engagement** — all without in-person events.

## Creating a Continuous Content Strategy with Impact

When INAA first approached us, they were seeking a content marketing agency that understood the **accountancy sector** and could **deliver thought-leadership content** with genuine insight and value.

After an initial strategy and ideation session in May 2019, we agreed to deliver **four 1,000-word articles per month** supported by a long-term content calendar. This structure provided clarity, consistency, and the opportunity to **collaborate closely** — sharing timely industry insights and responding to client feedback in real time.

## Using SEO to Drive Website Traffic

Our work didn't stop at writing. We ensured every piece of content was aligned with a strong **SEO strategy**, focusing on **search intent**, keyword research, and **current fintech trends** relevant to INAA’s target audience.

By tracking keyword performance and search engine rankings, we saw outstanding results. For example:

> The article **["How Does China’s DCEP Currency Work?"](https://www.inaa.org/blog/how-does-china-s-dcep-currency-work/)** (published July 2020) appeared at **position 3 on Google** — just weeks after going live.

This SEO-first mindset allowed us to **consistently increase INAA's visibility**, drawing in readers searching for credible financial insight.

## Keeping Members Engaged Without Events

The **COVID-19 pandemic** forced many membership organisations to pause in-person events. INAA was no exception. But they recognised an opportunity to **keep their community engaged** through digital channels.

We produced a mixture of **news-style content**, **expert interviews**, and **industry commentary**, helping INAA retain relevance and strengthen its value to members.

Interviewing board members and professionals allowed us to create **highly technical content** in the right tone — turning complex industry conversations into **engaging, accessible articles**.

> “By working in close partnership with INAA over an extended period of time, we’ve built a strong, authentic relationship that continues to thrive.”

## Results That Last

From **page-one Google rankings** to **continued member engagement**, our long-term partnership with INAA has delivered measurable value.

CopyHouse continues to act as an extension of their marketing team — providing content that not only informs, but also **positions INAA as a trusted voice** in the global accounting space.
