    Working from end to end with Account Technologies was an extremely productive experience. We really got to know them from our initial conversations and during our brand workshop, and they also learned a lot about us. This workshop laid the foundation for the project. The insights received allowed us to create a functional, clear and crisp brand book and landing page that resonates with Account Technologies’ target audience.

# Building Relationships and Providing Comprehensive Marketing Support for Avalara

Tax isn’t a subject that usually fascinates or intrigues new customers. This was a significant hurdle for US-based SaaS business **Avalara**, a global leader in tax compliance software.

Avalara’s in-house team has years of experience making tax topics more engaging. With over **30,000 customers in 95 countries**, they’re constantly entering new markets and producing new content. But even the best teams need scalable support — and that’s where CopyHouse stepped in.

## Small Content, Big Impact

Avalara’s key challenge was **workload**. With ambitious growth goals, the demand for content was rising fast. Creating it all in-house would be time-consuming and costly — especially if hiring new talent was required.

In **October 2021**, Avalara partnered with CopyHouse for an initial **trial project** comprising several short-form blogs. 

### Why start small?

Trial projects are a great way to build trust — and prove value quickly. For Avalara, our priority was solving their immediate challenge: high-volume content delivery. 

To support this, we focused on:
- **Speedy turnaround** to remove bottlenecks  
- **Quality content** that needed minimal internal revisions  
- **Well-researched blogs** aligned with Avalara’s voice and audience  

The success of this trial marked the beginning of an ongoing partnership.

## Scaling Up: Content Strategy, Social Media and More

Following our initial success, Avalara expanded the scope of work with CopyHouse significantly.

### Our support has included:
- Long-form content such as **guides and whitepapers**  
- **Third-party content** creation and syndication  
- **Organic social media copy** to grow brand visibility  
- **Content strategy** development to support Avalara’s growth  

We’ve worked closely with Avalara’s teams across **multiple time zones**, supporting both **UK and US operations**. Rather than acting as a traditional agency, we became a true **extension of their internal marketing function**.

Our teams collaborate regularly with Avalara’s **legal and editorial reviewers**, streamlining sign-off processes and getting approved content live — fast.

## A Trusted Partner in Long-Term Success

Thanks to our dedication to **high-quality content**, fast turnarounds and strategic support, we’ve earned the trust of Avalara’s marketing leadership. As the company continues to scale globally, we remain a reliable and flexible partner.

Avalara’s success is our success — and our relationship reflects that commitment.
