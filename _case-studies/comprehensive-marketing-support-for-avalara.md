# Building Relationships and Providing Comprehensive Marketing Support for Avalara

Tax isn’t a subject that usually fascinates or intrigues new customers. This was a significant hurdle for US-based SaaS business **Avalara**, a global leader in tax compliance software.

Avalara’s in-house team has years of experience making tax topics more engaging. With over **30,000 customers in 95 countries**, they’re constantly entering new markets and producing new content. But even the best teams need scalable support — and that’s where CopyHouse stepped in.

## Small Content, Big Impact

Avalara’s key challenge was **workload**. With ambitious growth goals, the demand for content was rising fast. Creating it all in-house would be time-consuming and costly — especially if hiring new talent was required.

In **October 2021**, Avalara partnered with CopyHouse for an initial **trial project** comprising several short-form blogs. 

### Why start small?

Trial projects are a great way to build trust — and prove value quickly. For Avalara, our priority was solving their immediate challenge: high-volume content delivery. 

To support this, we focused on:
- **Speedy turnaround** to remove bottlenecks  
- **Quality content** that needed minimal internal revisions  
- **Well-researched blogs** aligned with Avalara’s voice and audience  

The success of this trial marked the beginning of an ongoing partnership.

## Scaling Up: Content Strategy, Social Media and More

Following our initial success, Avalara expanded the scope of work with CopyHouse significantly.

### Our support has included:
- Long-form content such as **guides and whitepapers**  
- **Third-party content** creation and syndication  
- **Organic social media copy** to grow brand visibility  
- **Content strategy** development to support Avalara’s growth  

We’ve worked closely with Avalara’s teams across **multiple time zones**, supporting both **UK and US operations**. Rather than acting as a traditional agency, we became a true **extension of their internal marketing function**.

Our teams collaborate regularly with Avalara’s **legal and editorial reviewers**, streamlining sign-off processes and getting approved content live — fast.

## A Trusted Partner in Long-Term Success

Thanks to our dedication to **high-quality content**, fast turnarounds and strategic support, we’ve earned the trust of Avalara’s marketing leadership. As the company continues to scale globally, we remain a reliable and flexible partner.

Avalara’s success is our success — and our relationship reflects that commitment.
