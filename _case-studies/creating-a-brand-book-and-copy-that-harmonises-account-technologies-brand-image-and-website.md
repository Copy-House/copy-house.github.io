## Creating a Brand Book and Copy that Harmonises Account Technologies' Brand Image and Website

Working from end to end with Account Technologies was an extremely productive experience. From our very first conversations through to delivery, the project was defined by collaboration and a deep mutual understanding of goals.

### A Foundation Built on Insight

We kicked off the engagement with a brand workshop, which proved to be a valuable exercise for both sides. The session helped us understand Account Technologies' core purpose, vision, tone of voice and personality — while also giving them a clear sense of how CopyHouse works and the value we bring.

These insights informed every stage of the project. By asking the right questions and aligning our creative direction with Account Technologies’ business goals, we were able to develop assets that felt both authentic and commercially relevant.

### Deliverables that Drive Consistency

Armed with our research and workshop takeaways, we created a modern, user-friendly **brand book** that captured their voice, visual identity, and messaging principles. This document now serves as a north star for Account Technologies' internal teams, ensuring all communications are aligned and consistent.

We also developed **website copy** for a refreshed landing page that reflects the brand’s updated tone and positioning — delivering a more engaging experience for their target audience and supporting lead generation efforts.

> “Working from end to end with Account Technologies was an extremely productive experience. We really got to know them from our initial conversations and during our brand workshop, and they also learned a lot about us. This workshop laid the foundation for the project. The insights received allowed us to create a functional, clear and crisp brand book and landing page that resonates with Account Technologies’ target audience.”
