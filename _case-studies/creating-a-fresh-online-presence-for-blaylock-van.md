# Creating a Fresh Online Presence for Blaylock Van

While Blaylock Van is the oldest continuously operating African-American-owned investment bank in the United States, in the finance industry, it's crucial to never show your age. As such, Blaylock Van needed a fresh, modern-looking website to replace their existing one.

They approached CopyHouse not only to build a new website but also to ensure it was regularly populated with new, engaging content that would appeal to their audience and attract new clients. Read on to learn more about how we fulfilled Blaylock Van’s requirements and refreshed their entire online presence.

## What Needed to Change?

Blaylock Van had three key problems they wanted to address with their new website:

1. **Website Aesthetics**: Their existing site felt tired and outdated, lacking the modern polish of competitors.
2. **Number of Pages**: The site had too many disconnected pages, making navigation cumbersome.
3. **Complexity of Information**: The language used was dense and full of jargon, making it inaccessible to prospective clients.

## Restructuring and Refreshing the Blaylock Van Website

We began with a complete overhaul of the website structure. By flattening the hierarchy and ensuring key pages (like services and contact) were easily accessible from the homepage, we streamlined the user experience.

Next, we rewrote the landing page copy to cut back on financial jargon, highlight Blaylock Van’s expertise, and optimise for SEO. This content was designed to resonate with target audiences while boosting search engine visibility.

The final design phase focused on modernising the site. We replaced dated elements with clean, minimalist visuals and introduced a sleeker layout. The result? A visually appealing, user-friendly website that communicated trust and clarity.

### The Results

- **189% increase in unique visitors** compared to the old site’s best performance.
- **Peak organic traffic of 374 visitors**, surpassing the previous site’s two-year high of 354.
- Improved site navigation, increased engagement and boosted clarity of Blaylock Van’s core value proposition.

## Populating the Blaylock Van Website

A beautiful website is only the start — to sustain momentum, Blaylock Van needed valuable, ongoing content.

We delivered:

- **Thought leadership blogs** on financial careers and industry trends to attract organic traffic.
- A **2023 Retrospective** that showcased successes and was repurposed for both the site and direct client communications.
- **Regular updates** on the Transactions page to showcase recent deals and build credibility.

Thanks to our ongoing content efforts, **Blaylock Van’s authority score doubled** from 5 to 10 — despite launching on a completely new domain.
