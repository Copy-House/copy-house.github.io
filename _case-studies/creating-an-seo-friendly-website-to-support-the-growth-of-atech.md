## Creating an SEO-Friendly Website to Support the Growth of Atech

When a business expands, its marketing must grow with it. Atech — a Microsoft-specialist cloud service provider — had outgrown their existing website. They approached CopyHouse to help refresh their messaging, reposition their brand, and create SEO-optimised content that would reflect their evolution and attract mid-market clients.

> “CopyHouse was an agency we thought could definitely help us on the SEO front and produce content that was better positioned with SEO in mind.”  
> — *Jutta Kamp, Head of Marketing at Atech*

### The Challenge

Founded in 2006, Atech originally served start-ups but had significantly matured over the years — bringing in new clients, expanding services, and targeting a new audience. However, their website no longer reflected these changes. It looked outdated and failed to capture their current values, tone, or technical capabilities.

Atech needed content that reflected their status as a trusted partner for mid-market businesses and could support their ambition to grow. They also wanted to improve SEO performance — but without compromising on brand authenticity.

## Using SEO to Push Content Further

Atech had clear goals and relevant keywords in mind. Our job was to integrate these seamlessly into website copy that felt natural and authentic.

> “When we suggested what keywords we wanted to rank for, the CopyHouse team produced natural content around it. There was never a moment where I thought, ‘Aha! Here is a keyword’. Everything came across quite naturally.”  
> — *Jutta Kamp, Head of Marketing at Atech*

With modern SEO best practices guiding our content strategy, we crafted web copy that helped search engines and humans alike — boosting visibility without sounding forced.

## Building Brand Clarity Through Workshops

Before writing a single page, we needed to fully understand Atech — from their unique value proposition to their tone of voice. That’s where our **brand workshop** came in.

Over a two-day session with Atech’s marketing team, we uncovered:

- Brand values and mission
- Target personas and audience needs
- Product/service differentiators
- Challenges in existing messaging

This collaboration gave us the foundation to write clear, compelling content for **26 website pages**.

> “The brand workshops were out of our comfort zone, but they helped us define our messaging. We hadn’t had time to do that before. Now, our sales team is proud to send prospects to the website.”  
> — *Jutta Kamp, Head of Marketing at Atech*

## Putting Atech in Control

We know that handing over your content can feel risky. That’s why communication and collaboration are central to how we work. At every stage, Atech remained involved — shaping direction, reviewing drafts, and sharing feedback.

> “They were super organised and prompt with feedback. The writing process was a breeze. I'd love to collaborate with them again sometime.”  
> — *Richard Braggins, Content Strategist, CopyHouse*

## A Fresh Start, Backed by Strategy

With the new website launched and brand guidelines in place, Atech is now equipped to meet the demands of a growing client base. Their site not only reflects who they are today — it’s built to support where they’re going next.
