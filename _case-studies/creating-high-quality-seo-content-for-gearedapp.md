## Creating High-Quality SEO Content For GearedApp

### Increasing GearedApp's Site Traffic With High-Quality SEO Content

Turning sophisticated tech products into relatable content isn’t easy — especially when you’re juggling day-to-day development projects. That’s where CopyHouse stepped in to support [GearedApp](https://www.gearedapp.com), a Scotland-based *Tech for Good* app and web development company.

They needed a content partner to help them produce **engaging, SEO-driven articles** that resonated with their target sectors — and we were ready to help.

## Working Collaboratively for Efficient Content Creation

We kicked off our partnership with a planning session to scope out content needs and long-term goals. GearedApp wanted:

- **Two blog articles per month**
- **Additional case studies** and ad-hoc content as needed

We then created a monthly **content calendar** tailored to GearedApp’s audience segments. Each article was mapped to relevant **keywords**, content pillars and marketing goals.

Our process included:

- Creating topic outlines for approval
- Conducting background research or interviews
- Producing SEO-optimised drafts
- Sharing in **Google Docs** for easy real-time collaboration
- Iterating based on structured feedback

This agile content process allowed us to move quickly while maintaining high quality — with **Slack, email and video calls** keeping everyone aligned.

## Building Trust Through Agile Teamwork

Our goal was to be an *extension* of GearedApp’s in-house team. That meant working in their style, being proactive, and making the review process effortless.

> “It has been such a relief to be able to discuss topics and ideas briefly, then receive a well-researched article, fully SEO optimised, within a matter of days.”
> — *Lara Findlay, Founding Director at GearedApp*

GearedApp appreciated that we could handle complex tech subjects — like agile development, platform builds and APIs — with minimal input from their team.

## Proving A Successful Partnership Through a Five-Star Review

The results of our partnership with GearedApp were clear:

- A **consistent stream of high-quality blog content**
- Improved **website traffic** and SEO performance
- Positive engagement from **target audiences**
- A [five-star Clutch review](https://clutch.co/profile/copyhouse#reviews) praising our communication, professionalism, and efficiency

We helped GearedApp move from sporadic, ad-hoc blog uploads to a **sustainable, strategic content model**. Their brand voice is stronger, and their online visibility continues to grow.
