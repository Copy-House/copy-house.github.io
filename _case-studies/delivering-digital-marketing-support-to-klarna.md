# How We Delivered Expert Digital Marketing Support to Klarna

There’s been an explosion of FinTech innovation since PSD2 launched. Unfortunately, new firms immediately encountered a problem: how to educate their target audience on the value of open banking and their USP as a solutions provider.

As an award-winning content marketing agency specialising in technology brands, communicating complex topics is our bread and butter. Here, we look back at our work with **Klarna**, a leader in open banking innovation across Europe.

## Challenge: Lacklustre SEO Performance and an Overburdened Marketing Team

Today, Klarna is one of the most recognisable names in financial services. Their all-in-one shopping app and the catchy promise of ‘pay in three easy instalments’ have positioned them as a leading retail force.

But just a few years ago, Klarna’s SEO performance was underwhelming — nowhere near the top of search engine results. Keen to dominate the **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** space and emerge as an industry thought leader, the brand needed **expert digital marketing support**.

Meanwhile, Klarna’s internal marketing team was at capacity, juggling both **B2C and B2B campaigns** across multiple markets and languages. It was a clear moment to call in reinforcements.

## Solution: An Expert B2B Content Marketing Agency

Klarna partnered with CopyHouse in **August 2020**, initially engaging us to conduct a comprehensive **SEO audit**. This revealed key areas for growth — both in content creation and brand positioning.

From there, we delivered a **bespoke content strategy** that combined search engine marketing (SEM) with educational storytelling. The focus? To elevate Klarna’s **open banking credentials** and build **brand awareness** through authoritative content on financial services trends.

### Our Work Included:
- Whitepapers and landing pages  
- Newsletters and blog articles  
- SEO copywriting and social media assets  
- Google Analytics performance reports

Together, these deliverables addressed every stage of the marketing funnel and aligned seamlessly with Klarna’s B2B ambitions.

As Klarna’s Senior Marketing Manager, **Elias Pitsavos**, shared:

> “Open banking is a relatively new technology that some may struggle to understand fully. We wanted to partner with an agency that could grasp the complexity of the topic. CopyHouse demonstrated a strong ability to turn high-tech subjects into digestible content, which made them the perfect fit for us.”

## Result: Flexible B2B Content Marketing Services When Needed

Following the success of our initial campaigns, Klarna retained CopyHouse on an **ad hoc basis** for specialist support. Notable projects included:

- **Client case studies**  
- An **ultimate glossary** of open banking terms  
- Support during the launch of the **Klarna Kosma** sub-brand  

Despite structural changes at Klarna, we provided **scalable B2B content marketing services** to support their evolving goals.

Today, Klarna boasts:
- **150M+ active consumers**  
- **500,000+ merchants**  
- Operations across **45 countries**

This partnership helped establish CopyHouse as a trusted provider to leading payment service providers across Europe.
