## Developing Customer Avatars to Help ByzGen Understand their Target Audience and Produce Seamless Content

Knowing and understanding who your target audience is, is a must in B2B content marketing. At CopyHouse, we encourage our clients and all other businesses to sit down and really understand their audience by creating a customer avatar.

Only once you’ve done this can you market directly to them, rather than creating bland, generalised content. After all, when you speak to everyone, you reach no one.

That was exactly the case for ByzGen, a blockchain platform that streamlines data exchange by empowering decision-makers with a safe and secure process to share sensitive information.

They reached out to CopyHouse to create engaging, digestible copy that would connect their brand with the right audience.

## Creating a Customer Avatar Suitable for ByzGen

During the CopyHouse core messaging workshop, the ByzGen team sat down with Content Lead Stuart Cameron to delve deep into who they are and who their customers truly are.

To develop their ideal customer avatar, we explored:

- Their customers’ pain points
- How to communicate using the right tone of voice
- How to address challenges and decision-making journeys
- The role of technical versus non-technical stakeholders

This reflection helped ByzGen better define their messaging and targeting.

> “The workshop was a very enlightening experience and allowed us as a team to dig deep into our brand and understand who we’re targeting. It was a healthy exercise that enabled us to see where any misalignments were and how we can correct them.”

## Taking B2B Content One Step Further with Website Copy

ByzGen had recently completed a rebrand and asked CopyHouse to create SEO-optimised landing page copy, external content, and case studies.

After understanding the business and its goals, our team crafted landing pages that unified the website’s tone, message, and structure. One of their key challenges was tone of voice—especially communicating across different industries.

With our expertise in tech and FinTech, we were able to simplify complex ideas and remove jargon, making their offering more accessible.

> “CopyHouse did a great job streamlining the content and capturing exactly what we wanted and who we were.”  
> — *Matthew Birks, Chief Operating Officer, ByzGen*

## Producing Insightful Case Studies to Generate Leads

To showcase the value of their technology, ByzGen needed case studies that highlighted real-world success stories.

We helped them develop case studies that:

- Highlighted flexibility across industries
- Demonstrated enterprise-level use cases
- Maintained a clear, accessible tone

> “CopyHouse produced some great content! However, my favourite piece would have to be *Driving Transparency and Auditability to Improve MiFID II Compliance*. Even six months on, this case study is still very relevant.”  
> — *Matthew Birks, Chief Operating Officer, ByzGen*

## Results That Speak as Loud as the Content

The immediate feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Their SEO-optimised landing pages were:

- Easier to navigate
- More professional
- Free from confusing tech jargon

The case studies continue to serve as trust-building content, demonstrating value to prospective clients.

> “Working on ByzGen’s website copy and case studies was a breeze. We had regular check-ins and project updates, filled in any knowledge gaps with interviews and had a clear website wireframe to work with.”  
> — *Richard Braggins, Content Strategist, CopyHouse*
