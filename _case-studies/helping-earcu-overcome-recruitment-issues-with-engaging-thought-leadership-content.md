## Creating SEO-Compliant Thought Leadership Content for eArcu

eArcu’s brief began at a time of significant change. Following the Brexit agreement, many UK businesses faced uncertainty in hiring EU nationals. eArcu wanted to address this shift with meaningful content that guided their audience through the transition.

To support them, our team:

- Interviewed subject matter experts
- Researched the implications of Brexit on hiring practices
- Produced SEO-optimised content to increase visibility

We also tackled the subject of **diversity and inclusion** in the workplace, producing a widely praised piece that helped strengthen eArcu’s brand and values through relevant, thought-provoking insight.

> “The piece on Brexit was definitely interesting to research and the statistics which came from it were incredibly thought-provoking. However, my favourite piece would probably have to be the one we did on diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This was a fun piece to research and really helped us shine a light on how employers can be more inclusive when hiring.”

By applying keyword strategy and search intent analysis, we ensured the right audience found and engaged with this content, helping generate relevant traffic and new leads.

## Harmonising Copy and Design to Break Down Complex Information

Striking the right balance between copy and design can be tricky. Too much visual flair without context leads to confusion, while too much copy without design can appear dry and lose readers’ attention.

eArcu was especially keen to present their ideas using **infographics**. At the time, CopyHouse didn’t yet have an in-house design function—so we collaborated with Cargill Creatives to bring the content to life visually. The success of this partnership was so strong, it directly influenced our decision to launch a dedicated internal design team shortly after.

> “When writing content we usually picture what it would look like on a website, leaflet etc. But this time we had to keep in mind that it was going to be an infographic. We worked alongside the graphic designers to help create some great pieces for eArcu to use.”  
> — *Callum Henderson, Senior Copywriter at CopyHouse*
