## Helping InPlayer Repurpose Their Content to Boost Their Search Results on Google

Boosting traffic to your website and ranking high on Google is a challenge without strong SEO foundations. Even with high-quality content, poor SEO can stop it from being seen by your target audience. That’s why over 70% of marketers say SEO is more effective than other marketing tactics.

**InPlayer**, a global leader in pay-per-view subscription solutions, understood the need to take action. They deliver thousands of live events profitably across the OTT space—serving rights owners, agencies, artists and major corporations. But without SEO expertise, they found their exceptional content wasn’t performing online.

## Using SEO to Push InPlayer’s Content Further

In early 2021, InPlayer engaged CopyHouse for a short-term project. Their goal? Repurpose and optimise existing blog content, and create new pieces that would support their overall SEO strategy.

Although InPlayer had a library of well-written blogs and thought leadership articles, they struggled with discoverability. The marketing team lacked the SEO know-how to improve visibility, missing out on critical keyword opportunities.

To address this, we began with a **brand and messaging workshop** to understand InPlayer’s tone of voice, goals and key audience personas. From there, our team developed a tailored **SEO and Content Audit** featuring:

- Priority keywords
- Keyword volumes and difficulty rankings
- Audience intent analysis

Armed with this insight, InPlayer could immediately begin applying SEO principles to both existing and new content—boosting visibility and enhancing relevance.

## Repurposing Old Content in a Competitive Market

Streaming is a fast-moving industry. New platforms and trends emerge constantly, meaning older content often becomes outdated—even if it still attracts traffic.

> “They had an excellent piece on *10 Important Trends Shaping On-Demand Digital Entertainment*, which needed repurposing as some of the information was no longer relevant to a rapidly changing market.”  
> — *Stuart Cameron, Senior Copywriter at CopyHouse*

Our approach was to **redevelop high-potential articles**—updating stats, refining structure, adding new CTAs, and inserting optimised keywords to drive organic traffic.

We also made the content more **mobile-friendly**, improving UX and reducing bounce rates. Our team used Semrush and Google Analytics to fine-tune articles and track performance improvements.

> “Some articles were doing well, but they lacked structure or weren’t mobile-friendly. By improving sentence structure and aligning with SEO research, we were able to attract more viewers.”  
> — *Callum Henderson, Senior Copywriter at CopyHouse*

## The Results

InPlayer’s biggest challenge was visibility—something we helped solve through:

- **SEO audits and research** that gave them a roadmap for success  
- **Content repurposing** that salvaged strong ideas and gave them new life  
- **Clearer structure and CTA integration** that increased readability and engagement

By the end of the project, InPlayer had a library of search-optimised, accessible and engaging content—positioning them competitively in a fast-paced market.

> “Repurposing content was incredibly fun! It’s efficient when your old content is really good. If you reshape and reform it, it can still work exceptionally well.”  
> — *Richard Braggins, Content Strategist*
