# Helping Meta to Define ‘Brand Suitability’

Creating a definition requires a clear and commonly held understanding of a particular topic. But how do you define an ideology that, by nature, means different things to different people?

As one of the foremost names in online advertising and social media, Meta knew that when it came to taking a definitive stance on brand suitability — how to protect it, and how it differs from brand safety — their messaging had to be crystal clear.

## Our Journey Into the Metaverse

Our partnership with Meta began in **summer 2021**, when the company invited CopyHouse to join their **Marketing Supplier Program**. This rigorous process involved our team passing the **Meta Certified Creative Strategy Professional** exam — a major milestone in our relationship.

Soon after, Meta asked us to ghostwrite a **1,000-word article** for *The Drum* titled:  
**“How artificial intelligence is helping to measure creative effectiveness in marketing”**

The result was a clear success:

> “I am very happy with the end results and looking forward to seeing the article published!”  
> — *Maria Pavlova, Marketing Science Partner, Global Clients & Categories at Meta*

This success led to further collaborations, including:
- An **internal presentation** on *Content Marketing in the Metaverse*
- An **external thought leadership piece** on *Creativity in the Metaverse*

## A Definitive Collaboration

Our most ambitious collaboration with Meta to date began as a **3,000-word white paper** on **Brand Safety & Suitability**. Initially scoped for two weeks, the project quickly evolved — growing both in size and significance.

Early discussions with Meta made two things clear:
1. The paper needed to **go beyond** basic definitions.  
2. It would require **extensive internal reviews** from teams across Meta.

The final guide aimed to:
- Position Meta as a **thought leader** on Brand Suitability  
- Educate agencies and advertisers on how suitability differs from safety  
- Highlight Meta’s collaborations with industry groups like **GARM**  
- Clarify policies around **context adjacency**  
- Showcase Meta’s **advertiser-facing controls** and **third-party verification tools**

## The CopyHouse Approach

At CopyHouse, **dialogue is key** to every project. For this collaboration, we followed our tried-and-tested white paper process:

### Step 1: Stakeholder Debrief
We held a deep-dive call with Meta’s project stakeholders to understand their vision and key priorities.

### Step 2: SME Interviews
We conducted interviews with Meta subject matter experts to capture first-hand knowledge and insights.

### Step 3: Outlining the Vision
Our team produced **three detailed outlines**, refining the structure and narrative until it aligned with Meta’s objectives.

### Step 4: Writing & Iteration
Once approved, we produced a **comprehensive 5,000-word white paper** that clarified Meta’s position and delivered on all content goals.

> “Everything came together rather quickly. Thank you for your support, and we’ll definitely consider CopyHouse again for future projects.”  
> — *Dennis Petrone, Marketing Manager, Brand Safety & Suitability at Meta*
