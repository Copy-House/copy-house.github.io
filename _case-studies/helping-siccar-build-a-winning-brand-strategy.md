## Helping SICCAR Build A Winning Brand Strategy

### How Our Brand Workshop Helped SICCAR Harness the Power of Targeted Marketing

Most technology companies face similar marketing challenges — especially when it comes to articulating their value. In September, CopyHouse ran a full-day [brand workshop](https://www.copyhouse.io/services/brand-strategy) with deep tech firm [SICCAR](https://www.siccar.net/) to help them refine their messaging, identify their audience, and position themselves for growth.

## Why SICCAR Needed a Brand Workshop

SICCAR enables organisations to securely share sensitive data using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Like many innovators in the tech space, they faced a common challenge: how to convey the **value** of their solution without overwhelming their audience with technical detail.

To drive commercial traction, SICCAR needed to reframe their brand and content strategy — with a focus on **audience education** and **clear value communication**.

## Helping SICCAR Understand Their Audience

Our workshop focused on building the foundation for a brand strategy that would speak directly to their ideal customers. Key components included:

- **Market segmentation**
- **Customer avatars**
- **Value proposition alignment**
- **Competitor analysis**
- **Tone of voice discovery**
- **Storytelling & narrative clarity**

### Market Segmentation

We helped SICCAR define two core audience segments:

- **Private Sector** – e.g. Oil & Gas companies concerned with operational security
- **Public Sector** – e.g. government organisations like SAAS, focused on compliance and efficiency

Understanding these groups enabled SICCAR to tailor content more effectively and avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.

### Target Customer Avatars

Together, we built detailed customer avatars. This helped bring each market segment to life — from job titles and pain points to preferred communication channels. For example:

- **Private sector personas** care about protecting citizen data and engage most via **Twitter**.
- **Public sector personas** prioritise operational continuity and are best reached through **email** and community platforms.

## The Impact of SICCAR’s Brand Workshop

The workshop not only aligned the team around a **clear market focus**, but also gave SICCAR the tools to:

- Develop tailored messaging for each segment
- Identify strategic distribution channels
- Understand how different pain points map to their offering

Ultimately, the workshop enabled SICCAR to take a more confident, customer-centric approach to their marketing — setting the stage for growth and improved brand recognition.
