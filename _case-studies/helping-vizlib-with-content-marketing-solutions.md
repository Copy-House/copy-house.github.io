# Content Across the Pond: Helping a Global SaaS Vendor With SEO Content Marketing Services

Businesses undergoing digital transformations need reliable SaaS vendors to guide them. But before that, those same SaaS vendors need content marketing solutions to help build brand awareness and trust with consumers.

In this case study, we’re looking back at our work with **Vizlib**, a global BI software development firm that specialises in value-added products for Qlik Sense. Read on to see how expert support from a leading technology marketing agency helped transform their brand presence.

## Challenge: Big Plans but Too Little Time

Vizlib is a London-based business intelligence (BI) solutions provider. Their suite of software products acts as plug-ins for the wider Qlik ecosystem, extending user capabilities to analyse data and visualise trends. With a no-code interface, Vizlib empowers users from all technical backgrounds — putting them in direct competition with industry leaders like Tableau and Power BI.

Operating across both the UK and US markets (under the sub-brand **Astrato**), Vizlib’s marketing team was stretched across multiple regions, industries, and tones of voice. Each audience demanded tailored content — with separate messaging, spelling, and structure — all without overlapping or duplicating materials.

What they needed was a **reliable partner** capable of delivering consistent, SEO-optimised content at scale and speed.

## Solution: A Specialist Technology Marketing Agency

Vizlib partnered with CopyHouse in September 2022 under a monthly content retainer that included:

- One 1,500-word pillar article and  
- Three 1,000-word supporting articles  
- For **each brand** — Vizlib and Astrato  
- Totaling **9,000 words per month** across eight deliverables

To maintain quality and scale, we dedicated **four copywriters** to the account, enabling rapid turnaround while preserving accuracy, tone and brand voice. Each article was backed by strategic SEO guidance and allowed for up to two rounds of amends.

Thanks to this setup, we delivered structured, keyword-rich content with clear brand distinction — all within two-week production cycles.

## Result: Flexible B2B Content Marketing Services When Needed

Over the course of **11 months**, CopyHouse produced nearly **150,000 words** of B2B SEO content for Vizlib and Astrato. The structure of the partnership evolved to meet changing priorities, including:

- Swapping deliverables between brands based on monthly focus  
- Expanding pillar content to deepen value  
- Prioritising keywords and topics that aligned with marketing goals  

The collaboration ended on a high note, with both teams expressing gratitude and a strong desire to reconnect in future. One Vizlib team member summed it up best:

> “The feeling is completely mutual. We will be sure to reach out in future when projects crop up! All the best and thanks to you all once again.”

We're proud to have supported Vizlib’s growth into a global company with 1,000+ enterprise customers and 150 employees across four countries. Today, Vizlib is part of **insightsoftware**, positioning them for even greater expansion.
