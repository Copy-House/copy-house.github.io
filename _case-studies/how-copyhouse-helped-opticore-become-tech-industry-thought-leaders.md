In the increasingly complex tech space, enterprises around the world are now dependent on trusted partnerships to function — particularly when it comes to software vendors and cloud-based services.

In these circumstances, it can be overwhelming for the uninitiated to find the right collaborators who understand your business's needs. This is why having a consultant behind you can make all the difference.

This is Opticore’s role in the grand scheme of things. [Opticore](https://www.opticoreit.com/) is a London-based firm of bona fide cloud and IT infrastructure gurus who are dedicated to helping their clients optimise their networks when undertaking the weighty task of digital transformation.

However, with so many competitors in this space vying for the attention of high-quality leads, Opticore wanted to push their expertise and value proposition to the forefront with an in-depth content marketing campaign and strategy.

Their internal marketing team turned to CopyHouse for support in this venture. This case study will explore how CopyHouse worked with Opticore to craft a winning marketing strategy and deliver a bevy of thought-leadership articles, a comprehensive survey report, and detailed webinar, and much more.

## The Challenge

When Opticore got in touch with CopyHouse for help with their content marketing campaign, they had two main objectives in mind:

1.  To raise brand awareness of Opticore.
2.  To obtain leads through content promotion.

Opticore wanted CopyHouse to *focus on SEO and digital campaign optimisation.* However, there were three big roadblocks to our two teams achieving this:

1.  This was the company’s first real outreach marketing campaign, meaning that they were in relatively unknown territory.
2.  Opticore wanted to clearly establish a set of working processes that they could follow for future outreach campaigns.
3.  Opticore had never collaborated with a third party on its content marketing efforts. This was its first time collaborating with an agency.

With this in mind, CopyHouse’s goals were to assist Opticore with ideating content and crafting a strategy for a winning thought leadership campaign that would target high-level CTOs and other key decision-makers in tech companies, while simultaneously building a blueprint for future campaigns, and making the partnership with us as stress-free as possible.

So, how did our agency achieve this, and what did Opticore’s eventual thought leadership campaign look like?

## The Solution

For starters, CopyHouse began by taking a deep dive into Opticore’s brand and current marketing efforts. We extensively analysed their competitors, business model, and various service offerings and conducted an extensive content audit of their website and prior marketing materials.

We then worked with Opticore to research their buyer personas, brand guidelines, and messaging, and get a feel for their TOV and values. From there, we also sat down with Opticore’s marketing team for a 2-hour-long campaign workshop, to clearly determine their goals and barriers, and craft a roadmap to success.

After setting down these foundations, our strategy team decided that the best way to establish Opticore’s thought leadership would be through their recent survey of over 500 professionals across a variety of industries on the subject of challenges of achieving digital transformation and upgrading their IT infrastructure. Off the back of this, we elected to draft, write, and edit a wide swathe of content that would expand on its findings. This included thought leadership articles, infographics, social media posts, a survey report, landing pages, a webinar script, email copy, and repurposed webinar videos.

CopyHouse also assisted with the webinar itself, writing the script and outline and hosting it on our Zoom account. However, it was white-labeled, and CopyHouse was essentially invisible in the whole thing. To bring in an expert speaker for the webinar, we leveraged our own extensive network of IT stakeholders to bring in Jenna Reese, CEO of Connect Centric, as a guest on the webinar.

## The Results

As a result of our collaboration, Opticore has since managed to achieve a large number of registrations to its webinar, as well as a significant increase in website traffic and impressions thanks to the ongoing delivery of our articles and other content.

At its peak this year, the site managed to boast over **7,900 visitors** in just one month, compared with the site’s 1,000 visitor average at the same time last year. Meanwhile, our analytics indicate that organic traffic has almost **doubled** in the space of just **one year**.

This has allowed the enterprise to boost its brand awareness among key decision-makers and establish thought leadership in the space. CopyHouse is continuing to partner with Opticore, and we’re looking forward to aiding them with more campaigns in the future.
