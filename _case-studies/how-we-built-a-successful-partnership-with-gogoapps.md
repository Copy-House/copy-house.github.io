## How We Built A Successful Partnership with GogoApps

Turning sophisticated technology and software solutions into engaging, digestible content is no easy task — especially when the goal is to resonate with both technical and non-technical audiences.

**GogoApps**, a software development and design provider based in Poland, approached CopyHouse seeking a native English-speaking agency with the ability to create **captivating content** for their technical audience. With a strong track record in **B2B content marketing for SaaS and technology brands**, we were the perfect fit.

## Thorough Briefing From the Start

To kick off the project, we held an in-depth discovery session with the GogoApps team. Their open and detailed briefing process enabled us to fully grasp the **technical intricacies of their work**, their brand values, and what mattered most to their audience.

To build a clear understanding of their market, we conducted both **client interviews** and **independent research**. This allowed us to create detailed **customer personas**, giving us the insight needed to write content that resonates across audience segments.

## Going the Extra Mile for High-Quality Content

Our first assignment was a blog article exploring the **Go programming language (Golang)** — a topic that requires specialist technical knowledge. While GogoApps provided fantastic input, our team took it a step further.

> One of our in-house copywriters completed a **two-hour course on Golang** to deepen their understanding and ensure the content would meet the expectations of expert developers.

This investment allowed us to deliver an authoritative yet accessible article that could speak to readers with **varying levels of technical knowledge** — showcasing GogoApps’ expertise in a way that aligned with their “Tech for Good” mission.

## Agile Teamwork for an Efficient Workflow

From day one, our partnership with GogoApps was grounded in **agility and transparency**. We communicated regularly using **Slack** and managed projects via **Trello**, providing clear visibility into every stage of the content production process.

This workflow allowed for:

- Fast implementation of feedback  
- Clear ownership and accountability  
- On-schedule delivery of every piece  
- Real-time updates across both teams

> “Our feedback calls were purposeful and organised, contributing to a smooth and efficient workflow.”

Thanks to this seamless approach, we consistently delivered content that exceeded expectations — and laid the groundwork for further collaboration.

## Our Successful Partnership Reflected in a 5-Star Review

GogoApps awarded us a **five-star review on Clutch**, recognising our content quality, efficiency and professionalism. Our Managing Director, Kathryn Strachan, also received a glowing **LinkedIn recommendation** from GogoApps Business Developer, **Jakub Nowakowski**:

> “Every contact I had with Kate was pleasant and professional. I could always count on her expertise and problem-solving skills. You’ll be lucky to work with her and her team!”
