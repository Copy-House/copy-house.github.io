    Working from end to end with Account Technologies was an extremely productive experience. We really got to know them from our initial conversations and during our brand workshop, and they also learned a lot about us. This workshop laid the foundation for the project. The insights received allowed us to create a functional, clear and crisp brand book and landing page that resonates with Account Technologies’ target audience.

# Improving Landing Page SEO for Travelex

Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the foundation of many marketing plans and might be one of the most commonly discussed aspects of marketing. Creating a perfectly optimised web page is a difficult task, but the rewards are considerable — increased traffic and brand awareness, which can lead to higher sales.

Even the largest companies sometimes need help figuring out SEO. Travelex, a market-leading foreign currency exchange provider, needed our help improving SEO for the website of one of their premier clients: British supermarket giant Asda.

## The Content Challenges Facing Travelex

Travelex approached CopyHouse with two key challenges:

1. **No defined SEO strategy** for Asda’s currency exchange site, making it difficult to produce content that would consistently attract relevant traffic.
2. **Outdated, sales-heavy landing page copy** that didn’t align with Asda’s tone of voice or offer value to users. The content wasn’t engaging or informative, limiting its effectiveness in supporting conversions.

Our first priority was to lay the foundation for consistent and relevant content by developing a structured SEO strategy.

## How We Boosted Search Engine Rankings for Travelex

We began by identifying the most relevant and high-value keywords for Travelex’s audience — including phrases like *travel money*, *holiday money*, *foreign currency*, and *buy money*. These keywords helped guide topic ideation and content priorities, ensuring every page we created served a specific purpose.

We then tackled the copy. Our initial project involved rewriting the landing page for Asda’s USD currency exchange. The new version brought together strategic SEO, Asda’s brand voice, and customer-centric copy that helped inform and convert.

The results were immediate — Travelex commissioned eight more landing pages, including those for EUR and AUD. These pages not only ranked more effectively but also improved the overall customer journey on the site.
