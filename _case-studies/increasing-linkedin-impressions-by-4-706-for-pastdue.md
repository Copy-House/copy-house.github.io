## Increasing LinkedIn Impressions by 4,706% for Pastdue

Pastdue is a fintech company based in Scotland that provides debt collection services to some of the UK’s leading companies. However, despite their impressive client base, the company lacked a consistent marketing strategy and had never allocated a budget for marketing. As they expanded their digital services, they recognised the need for a robust and consistent online presence to reach their target audience, particularly on LinkedIn. To address this, Pastdue approached CopyHouse for marketing support.

### The Problem

Pastdue had never invested time or budget into marketing, and as they began to grow and adapt their products for a digital space, it became clear that a change was necessary. However, with no previous marketing experience, the company was unsure where to start. As a result, they reached out to Fintech Scotland for a recommendation, which led to them connecting with CopyHouse.

The company needed to quickly learn how to market their product in digital spaces, but with no previous marketing budget, they struggled to prioritise their goals. The primary objectives were to expand into new markets and increase brand awareness for both the company and its products. Additionally, their messaging was inconsistent and confusing, making it difficult for potential leads to understand the business. They also faced challenges with marketing their new product, DAAS, as its audience didn’t always understand its functionality.

### The Solution

To address these challenges, CopyHouse started with a workshop to gain a deep understanding of Pastdue’s brand, products, target audience, and marketing goals. Our Creative Director and Social Media Manager collaborated with the Pastdue team to discuss their ideas and help articulate them clearly.

During the workshop, CopyHouse developed a clear and actionable plan. One of the first steps was to redesign their visual elements, including their logo, fonts, and colour scheme. This gave the brand a modern and consistent identity, making it easier for their audience to recognise and engage. To ensure future consistency, we also created a comprehensive brand guideline document.

Next, we developed a tailored content plan for social media, focusing on LinkedIn — the platform most frequented by Pastdue’s target audience. Using the new brand guidelines, we built a long-term social media strategy featuring educational content, promotional offers, and industry updates, positioning Pastdue as a thought leader in their space.

### The Results

The impact was immediate. Within the first month, CopyHouse increased Pastdue’s LinkedIn impressions by **4,706%**. As the campaign continued, high engagement levels and growing brand awareness followed. With consistent branding and clearer messaging, Pastdue’s content became more effective at attracting new leads and customers.

### Conclusion

CopyHouse helped Pastdue transition from an inconsistent, reactive marketing approach to a strategic and robust digital presence. The results speak for themselves: a dramatic increase in LinkedIn visibility, improved brand clarity, and a stronger foundation for future growth.
