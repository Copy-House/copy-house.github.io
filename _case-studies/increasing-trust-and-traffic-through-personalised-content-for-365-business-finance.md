## Increasing Trust and Traffic Through Personalised Content for 365 Business Finance

### How We Helped 365 Business Finance Increase Their Traffic and Build Trust Through Personalised Content

Financial services providers often find it difficult to produce content that both informs and engages their audience. That was the case for **365 Business Finance**, a UK-based lender offering merchant cash advances of up to £200,000 to help SMEs grow.

When their **Marketing Manager, Mandy Warren**, noticed a content gap on their website and social media platforms, she turned to CopyHouse. Mandy recognised that a personalised content strategy could drive traffic and build trust — she just needed an agency with the time, skill and creativity to bring it to life.

## Helping Businesses Recover in a Time of Crisis with Helpful Content

Our collaboration began with a strategic workshop. Mandy joined our **Account Manager, Project Manager, and Copywriters** to develop a content roadmap that would genuinely support 365 Business Finance’s customers.

Together, we developed **content pillars** aligned with the customer journey — focusing on SME pain points and specific stages of the purchasing funnel. From there, we designed content that was not only informative but also deeply relevant, particularly during the **COVID-19 pandemic**, when many SMEs were navigating economic uncertainty.

> “We (CopyHouse Ltd) always have a game plan and that makes me feel greatly reassured.”  
> — *Mandy Warren, Marketing Manager at 365 Business Finance*

A standout project was a **hospitality sector comeback guide**, which provided practical, empathetic advice for SMEs looking to bounce back after lockdowns. It wasn’t just useful—it was timely, actionable and built trust with their audience.

> “I love how involved CopyHouse got when doing client-based blogs. We would chat with clients and understand how they survived COVID.”  
> — *Mandy Warren*

## Content Strategy Guaranteeing Long-Term Results

The results of our collaboration were clear:

- **Increased traffic** from optimised blog content  
- **Stronger social engagement** across LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram  
- **More inbound interest** and growing authority as a trusted SME lender  

> “I’m starting to post blogs on Instagram to direct traffic to the website and engagement has been great, so we can only go up from there.”  
> — *Mandy Warren*

This strategy positioned 365 Business Finance as not just a lender, but a supportive partner for small business success.

## The CopyHouse Way to Providing a Personalised Service

Mandy described our relationship as **seamless**. From ideation to delivery, she never had to chase us or worry about the quality of the work. We adapted to her team's bandwidth and budget — even when COVID temporarily paused marketing efforts.

> “CopyHouse were incredibly flexible, supportive and understanding throughout the six-month pause. When we were ready, they adapted quickly and picked things up without missing a beat.”

Our collaborative, client-first mindset meant Mandy always felt in control, without carrying the burden of execution. With trust established and results delivered, the partnership with 365 Business Finance is one we’re proud of.
