## Promoting Positive Values in the Tech Industry with GearedApp

### How We Helped GearedApp Position Themselves as the Go-To 'Tech for Good' Web and Mobile App Developers

[GearedApp](https://www.gearedapp.com/) is an Edinburgh-based development team building bespoke apps and web platforms for organisations of all sizes. As the pandemic shifted priorities in 2020, GearedApp needed additional marketing support to increase their SEO visibility and digital engagement — all while staying true to their **‘Tech for Good’** mission.

That’s where CopyHouse came in.

> “It took a lot of pressure off of us at a time where I didn’t have the time or the resources internally to be able to do the copywriting in-house.”  
> — *Lara Findlay, Director and Co-Founder, GearedApp*

## Helping GearedApp Boost Their Marketing Strategy Through Collaboration

With limited internal capacity, GearedApp partnered with CopyHouse to guide their **content creation and SEO strategy**. We collaborated closely to build out **targeted blog content** that would attract their ideal clients and reflect their unique values.

This holistic approach allowed the team to focus more on **long-term growth** and less on the day-to-day pressures of content production.

> “It’s really important for us to have regular content on our site, not just from an SEO perspective, but also to show that we are knowledgeable in our area and we are a great source of resources.”  
> — *Lara Findlay*

## Positioning GearedApp as a Leader in ‘Tech for Good’

From the start, GearedApp made it clear they wanted a partner who could **translate technical concepts into accessible messaging**, while showcasing their **collaborative, ethical culture**.

Our team crafted articles that demonstrated:

- The team’s development process and working model  
- The business’s stance on sustainability and ethical tech  
- Their collaborative work culture and user-led mindset  

This content helped establish GearedApp as more than just developers — but **purpose-driven partners** for digital transformation.

## Delivering Engaging, Strategic Content for Their Audience

To truly resonate with GearedApp’s audience, each piece of content had to reflect both **industry trends** and **brand personality**. One highlight was a **blog series looking back at their 7-year journey**, showcasing values, team spirit and growth.

The response? An **uptick in social media engagement**, increased website visits, and richer conversations with their audience on topics like **sustainability and agile development**.

## Creating Effective and Thought-Provoking Content with a Like-Minded Business

Cultural alignment was just as important as technical alignment. Both teams value transparency, sustainability, and remote working — making the collaboration feel seamless from the outset.

Using **Google Drive for visibility**, **multiple feedback rounds**, and **weekly check-ins**, we established a reliable workflow that integrated smoothly into GearedApp’s internal processes.

> “My favourite thing about working with CopyHouse was working with a very like-minded company and how easy it was to start working together.”  
> — *Lara Findlay*

## Boosting GearedApp’s Future Marketing Efforts

Beyond delivery, we helped GearedApp understand the **why** behind each piece of content. With guidance on **SEO, planning, and content strategy**, their team is now more empowered to lead future campaigns.

> “We’ve found them to be extremely helpful, very informative and a great like-minded team to work with. I’d definitely recommend them to anyone that’s struggling with creating copy or looking for experts within the technology area.”  
> — *Lara Findlay*
