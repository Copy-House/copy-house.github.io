# Providing A Comprehensive Marketing Overhaul for Future Platforms

A modern marketing strategy has many different parts: social media posts, short blogs, and thought leadership content. Some businesses do not acknowledge that each of these parts is equally important, and when taken as a whole, their combined effect can create massive amounts of new business for your company.

The digital product designers and engineers at Future Platforms understand the power of holistic marketing, but they did not have the bandwidth to create the amount of content they needed. So, they got in touch with our team for support.

Alongside the team leaders at Future Platforms, we created multi-part marketing campaigns that bring together modern marketing elements like personal branding with tried-and-true content like industry whitepapers. Keep reading to discover how we gave Future Platforms a total marketing overhaul.

## Creating Content Pillars

Our work with Future Platforms began in 2023 with a comprehensive whitepaper exploring the complexities of customer engagement. As Future Platforms design custom websites and brand apps for high-profile clients like Ralph Lauren, Domino's and PSG, understanding shifts in consumer expectations is paramount. Our collaborations aimed to establish the company as customer experience (CX) thought leaders.

To help reinforce this expertise, another part of our initial project together was the writing of multiple supporting blogs that discussed different aspects of the main whitepaper. Although a holistic marketing campaign has multiple parts that are treated equally, it’s still important to have central pieces of content that you can build everything around. In this instance, the whitepaper was the central pillar in a campaign that included everything from the blogs to promotional social media posts.

## Engaging, Business-Focused Content

If you’re looking to create engaging content that also directly advertises what your company can provide to your clients, case studies offer an effective solution. This was another aspect of our initial project with Future Platforms: we refreshed and updated several case studies detailing their previous projects.

As well as making the case studies more relevant to the current industry landscape, doing so ensured we could add content that advertised any new services that Future Platforms had introduced following the initial publication of the case studies. This led to a significant increase in the number of inbound leads for Future Platforms, specifically businesses looking for their brand strategy services.

## The Results of the Website Refresh

We’ve noticed a number of significant statistical improvements as a result of the website refresh we completed for Future Platforms. For example:

- **Peak organic traffic increased by 60%**, from 482 visitors to 769.  
- **Website authority score increased by 12.5%**, from 24 to 27.  
- **Average visit duration increased by 45 seconds**, meaning visitors explored more content and engaged more deeply.

These gains reflect improvements in SEO and a more compelling user experience.

## Social Media Support and Personal Branding

Our later work with Future Platforms in 2024 featured much more social media content, although long-form thought leadership content and blogs still played a significant role. To ensure the marketing campaign worked holistically, each part supported the other. The blogs helped push the content of the whitepaper, and the social media content helped advertise the blogs.

Given the increase in social media content, variety became a key consideration during our strategy conversations with the team leaders at Future Platforms. As well as promoting our other content, we moved on to more engaging social media content such as company newsletters and updates or interactive polls. We also began creating personal branding content for the senior leaders at Future Platforms.

## Key Aspects of Our Personal Branding Services

Personal branding is an important modern marketing technique that helps position small and medium companies as industry experts. By highlighting the skills and insights of the senior leaders of a business on their personal social media pages, an individual can elevate their personal brand and elevate the reputation of their business within a particular industry.

As part of our personal branding services, we interviewed Greet Jans and Remy Brooks, the managing directors of Future Platforms. By speaking with them and performing careful analysis of their existing social media content, we helped Greet and Remy create insightful social media content on topics relevant to their industry.

The results of the combined personal branding campaign and larger-scale corporate social media campaign were significant:

- **120% increase in organic social media growth**
- Boosted personal brand visibility, particularly for Greet Jans
- Further improvements in SEO and website traffic
