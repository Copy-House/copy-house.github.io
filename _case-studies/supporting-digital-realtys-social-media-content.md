It’s a fact that the larger and more widespread a business is, the more challenging its logistics will be. This axiom holds true even within the sphere of B2B and B2C marketing, internal and external comms, and PR.

When a business consists of multiple departments spread worldwide it can be tricky to ensure that all aspects of the company are singing from the same proverbial hymn sheet (or brand guidelines in this instance) while still effectively communicating with their respective regional audiences. In cases like this, support from an experienced content marketing agency can be invaluable.

[Digital Realty](https://www.digitalrealty.co.uk/) was one such enterprise that juggled several company social media accounts in several countries and subsidiaries while simultaneously attempting to establish thought leadership via its CEO's LinkedIn presence.

This case study explores how CopyHouse collaborated with Digital Realty to craft a comprehensive social media strategy, including brand guidelines, account management and bespoke content creation. Read on to learn more.

## The Challenge

As a global enterprise boasting +300 data centres worldwide, across 25+ countries on six continents, Digital Realty’s main challenge involved communicating the often-complex nuances of their tech and a macro perspective on the overall market.

This challenge was exacerbated further by the company’s recent period of growth and expansion (including an acquisition) and a rebrand. This period of change in the corporate culture has left many of its component parts disparate from the brand as a whole, and the company was struggling to unite their various regional teams' approach to social media and create a cohesive global brand presence.

However, the brand also had issues juggling the sheer volume of content filtered through its various social media channels and needed assistance with crafting reactive content that took advantage of emerging trends and news stories and editorial help, ensuring that all incoming posts adhered to its brand guidelines.

Thus, Digital Realty came to CopyHouse for assistance in delivering consistent brand messaging from a diverse range of subdivisions and stakeholders.

## The Solution

CopyHouse began by taking a deep dive into Digital Realty’s brand and current marketing efforts, as well as looking at its various regional subdivisions, to get a firm grasp of its values and the underlying aesthetic principles of their existing content.

Off the back of this, CopyHouse’s social media experts put their heads together to devise a comprehensive set of brand guidelines, as well as a robust social media strategy to help the brand set, measure, and achieve their marketing benchmarks.

Alongside this, CopyHouse has also been employed on the basis of a retainer, providing weekly support for the often-complex approvals process for social content via the social media management tool Oktopost. This entails ensuring posts submitted by their regional teams worldwide align with their brand guidelines.

Furthermore, CopyHouse has also worked to support the brand further by providing social media copy and design while creating bespoke posts for their channels and their President and CEO, Andy Power, each month.

## The Results

As a result of our collaboration, Digital Realty has been able to stay on top of its hectic posting schedule with help from CopyHouse while consolidating its messaging with the help of our brand guidelines and social media strategy.

Over the past year, Digital Realty’s social media posts have attained over **2.74 million impressions** and over **325,000 engagements** — an increase of **over 40%**. Furthermore, the engagement rate of Digital Realty’s posts has also seen a significant boost, jumping up by **53%** over the past year.

Digital Realty has benefited, in particular, during periods when its internal team was away on business trips or leave. CopyHouse was always available to ensure posting schedules remained uninterrupted, and its many social media channels flowed seamlessly.
