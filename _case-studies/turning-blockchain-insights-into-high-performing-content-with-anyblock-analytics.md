## Turning Blockchain Insights Into High-Performing Content with Anyblock Analytics

### Bringing Blockchain Service Pages to Life

Most high-tech firms face the same challenge — translating complex technical products into content that drives traffic, generates leads, and engages prospects.

[**Anyblock Analytics**](https://www.anyblockanalytics.com), a German blockchain solution provider, found themselves in this very position. After struggling to find a content partner that could truly understand and articulate their offering, they partnered with CopyHouse to revamp their service landing pages and SEO strategy.

## Turning Complex Topics Into Top Ranking Landing Pages

Anyblock had initially written their own landing pages — which meant:

- No **SEO strategy**
- Little **keyword visibility**
- Weak organic reach in key markets (US, UK, Germany)

To solve this, we kicked off a three-month collaboration focused on:

- **In-depth keyword research**
- **Content strategy aligned to search demand**
- SEO-optimised landing page content

Through brand workshops and interviews, we captured Anyblock’s voice and translated their solutions into customer-centric pages that addressed user pain points — while embedding high-volume US-focused keywords throughout.

Our work had an immediate impact. For example, the **Blockchain Services** landing page saw a **66% increase in traffic** during March and April — compared to the previous 69-day period.

We also improved the **relevance** and **readability** of each page, helping prospective clients better understand Anyblock’s offer.

## Creating High-Quality Copy With International Reach

Anyblock wanted to establish a stronger presence in the **US**, while also supporting visibility in **Germany** and the **UK**.

We tailored our keyword research to reflect this, prioritising:

- **American English** in tone and spelling
- **High US keyword search volumes**
- SEO compatibility across **multiple regions**

This balanced approach enabled us to generate traffic and boost rankings across all three markets.
