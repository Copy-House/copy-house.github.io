          <p class="testimonial-text-four-2">Creating a definition requires a clear and commonly-held understanding of a particular topic, item or subject matter. However, how do you go about defining an ideology that, by its very nature, means different things to different people?<br/>As one of the foremost names in online advertising, and social media, Meta’s words carry significant weight. As such, they knew that when it came to delivering a definitive and cohesive stance on brand suitability, how to protect it and how it differs from brand safety, Meta knew it had to get its messaging right.</p>
