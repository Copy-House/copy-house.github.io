# 5 Tips for Creating SEO Friendly Content that Gets Your Technology or FinTech Brand Noticed

Creating well-written content that engages your audience and sparks conversations within your industry is what every marketer strives to achieve. However, despite how well-written and designed your content may be, it can fall flat if it doesn’t have the right SEO embedded into it to help the content rank high on search engines.

Ranking high on search engines is essential because 75% of internet users don’t bother looking past page one of search engine results. Therefore, without correctly applying SEO to your content, it may never reach your target audience.

To help you get started, here are five of our best SEO tips for beginners.

## #1 Thorough Keyword Research

Keywords are one of the main ways search engines organise results, so effective keyword research is key to ranking well.

### How Do I Find the Right Keywords?

Start by creating a **customer avatar** — a fictitious profile of your ideal customer. Think about the questions they’re asking and the challenges they face. This insight can guide your keyword choices.

You can also research your competitors' content for inspiration (but never copy).

### Using Primary and Secondary Keywords

**Primary keywords** are the main terms you want to rank for.  
Example: `investing in stocks`

**Secondary keywords** are supporting terms used throughout your content.  
Example: `stocks and shares ISA`, `stocks to buy now`

### Short-Tail vs Long-Tail Keywords

**Short-tail keywords** (e.g. `online banking`) are broad and often high-traffic, but competitive.  
**Long-tail keywords** (e.g. `how to open an online bank account`) target more specific queries and are easier to rank for.

### Tools for Keyword Research

We recommend using [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com) to assess:

- **Search intent**

- **Search volume**
- **Keyword difficulty** (aim for scores below 70%)

## #2 Consider Your Title and Meta Descriptions

Your **page title** and **meta description** are the first things users see on search results pages.

### How to Optimise Titles and Meta Descriptions

- Keep titles between 30–60 characters
- Keep meta descriptions under 160 characters
- Include at least one target keyword
- Avoid ‘catfishing’ with misleading descriptions

## #3 Use Links Effectively

Use **internal** and **external** hyperlinks to enhance SEO.

- **Internal links** improve navigation and user experience
- **External links** to reputable sources boost credibility (but avoid linking to competitors)
- Search engines crawl these links to understand your site structure

**Tip:** Don’t overdo it. Only include links that genuinely benefit the reader.

---

## #4 Answer Questions to Appear in Snippets

**Featured snippets** are short answers Google shows at the top of results — and they boost visibility.

### How to Get Featured

- Use **question-based headings**  
  _E.g., What are APIs?_  
- Provide a **clear, concise answer** immediately after
- Maintain a readable tone for general audiences

Even if you’re not in the top organic spot, your content can still be featured if it clearly answers the user’s question.

---

## #5 Write Different Kinds of Content

Don’t just push product content. Mix up your formats to reach different segments of your audience.

### Examples:

- **Blog posts** on trends = Thought leadership
- **Case studies** = Proven results
- **Interviews** = Showcase culture and values

Keyword research should guide your strategy, but **original content based on your own insight** is what will make you stand out in a competitive market.
