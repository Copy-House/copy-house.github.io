# 5 ways to make your content stand out

When it comes to marketing technology or FinTech brands, it can be tough to cut through the noise. With so much competition, making your content stand out is more challenging — and more important — than ever.

At CopyHouse, our content creators have shared their top five tips to help your content rise above the crowd and establish your brand as an industry thought leader.

---

## 1. Cut through the noise and get straight to your point

The average web user’s attention span is just **10 to 20 seconds**. If your key message isn’t clear within that window, you're likely to lose them.

To stand out:

- Start with a compelling hook  
- Highlight key information early  
- Keep your message concise and focused  

💡 Design matters too. Research shows attention increases by **50 milliseconds** when content is well designed. Layout, colour, and typography can draw the reader’s eye to essential points and improve engagement.

## 2. Make sure your content looks as good as it sounds

The brain processes visuals **60,000x faster** than text — so how your content looks can be as important as what it says.

At CopyHouse, our writers and designers collaborate from the outset to ensure content is:

- **User-friendly** – making content easy to navigate and increasing time on page  
- **Digestible** – breaking down complex topics with clear layout and visuals  
- **Credible** – reinforcing brand professionalism and trust  
- **Memorable** – using infographics and design to make ideas stick  
- **Noticeable** – standing out in cluttered feeds and search results

## 3. Cater your content to your target audience

“If you market to everyone, you’ll reach no one.”

Tailoring content to specific audience segments makes your message more relevant and effective. Even if the reader isn’t the final decision-maker, personalisation creates a stronger connection.

🧠 Pro tip: Build customer avatars and map your messaging to their pain points, preferences, and stage in the buyer journey. If you're unsure how to do this, start with our [guide to creating customer avatars](https://www.copyhouse.io/insights/build-your-customer-avatar).

## 4. Use strong SEO keywords to ensure your content gets seen

Even the best content won’t succeed without visibility. **Search engine optimisation (SEO)** helps your content rank on Google and reach your target audience organically.

Being on page one of Google gives your content a **92% higher chance** of being seen.

At CopyHouse, we use SEO tools like **Semrush** to:

- Identify high-performing keywords  
- Analyse competitor content  
- Conduct technical audits  
- Track keyword trends and gaps  

By incorporating SEO insights into every content plan, we help clients drive long-term organic traffic.

## 5. Add your unique twist

Don't just stick to blog posts — explore content formats that suit your message and audience:

- Infographics  
- Podcasts  
- eBooks  
- Slide decks  
- Webinars  

As Katie Street of Street Agency shared in a TechTalks episode, not everyone has time for long-form content. Offering diverse formats ensures your message is accessible and memorable.

🎯 At CopyHouse, we match content types to each funnel stage:

- **Top of Funnel**: Blogs, infographics, thought leadership  
- **Middle of Funnel**: Whitepapers, webinars, case studies  
- **Bottom of Funnel**: Product guides, competitor comparisons, testimonials  

Explore what works best for your audience and repurpose your core messages across multiple formats.
