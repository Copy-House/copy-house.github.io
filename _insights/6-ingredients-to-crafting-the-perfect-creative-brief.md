# 6 ingredients to crafting the perfect creative brief

The ultimate quality of any content, no matter what format it takes, depends upon the quality of its briefing.

As an agency, our number-one objective is to strive to exceed our clients’ expectations and help them craft the content they need to achieve their marketing goals.

There’s a fair share of war stories to turn to on the agency side when it comes to briefing quality. We've been handed the gamut of briefs — many of which have been detailed, precise, and articulate. Others have been muddled, obtuse, or simply too nebulous to be helpful, leaving our team either battling against deadline to seek clarification or playing detective to work out what the client truly wants.

A good content marketing brief should never be a token effort. It should act as a bona fide blueprint to success, giving your collaborators all the tools they need to deliver the content you require. Without that high-quality raw material, your content will invariably suffer.

So, in this article, we’ll be sharing what we think separates a winning brief from a poor one — and how your business can ensure that any briefs you deliver will give you the best possible results from the agency you choose to work with.

## Writing a content marketing brief: the dos

### 1. Define your objectives

The first and most important aim of any content marketing brief is to clearly define the purpose of the content. Is the aim to promote thought leadership? To connect with your customers? Encourage debate, educate, or showcase your brand’s values?

Try to be as specific as possible about the true aim of the content — it may not be as obvious to your creative team as it is to you.

### 2. Clarify creative direction

How you word a piece of content is almost as important as the substance itself. With so many brands competing to be heard, creatives need to know what makes your brand unique.

So, provide as much information as possible about your tone of voice, logo usage, brand values, and even specific grammar or word preferences. This helps ensure your brand’s characteristics are woven into the final work.

### 3. Provide as many resources as possible

Creatives are often expected to speak fluently on topics they’re just beginning to explore. While content marketers are skilled at simplifying complexity, they can still benefit greatly from strong source material.

Include any links, resources, or internal documents that could guide your agency in the right direction. You don’t need to educate them fully — but giving direction speeds things up and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.

### 4. Include examples for reference

It’s always easier for creatives to meet your expectations when you provide examples of past content you liked — or that reflects your desired style or tone.

Include a few links or attachments that the team can reference before they start writing.

### 5. Tell us about your target audience

The audience will influence every part of the content — from structure to tone to message. So be specific about your personas.

If you haven’t created audience personas yet, consider scheduling a strategic workshop. At CopyHouse, we offer persona development services as part of our content strategy process.

### 6. Don’t forget about the big picture

It’s important to explain the bigger strategic context of the content. Where does it sit within the buyer journey? Is it part of a campaign or a standalone asset? How does it connect to your long-term goals?

This helps creatives understand how the piece contributes to a larger narrative, which can influence structure, CTAs, and how it links to other deliverables.

## CopyHouse: Here to serve your brief
