# 7 Ways to Tidy Up Your Content Strategy

Let’s do a bit of spring cleaning. That’s right, it’s time to take a look at your content strategy!

As with everything in life, if your content strategy isn’t up to date, it’s easy to get behind. When things get busy, creating content often falls to the bottom of the priority list — and getting back on track can be tricky.

But if you want to consistently attract and convert your audience, high-quality content must remain a priority.

In this article, we’ll walk you through how to review your existing content, remove what’s no longer working, and make more room for the high-value assets your audience will actually love.

---

## 1. Document Your Content

Start with an audit. Create a spreadsheet and catalogue all your existing content — by format (blog, podcast, video, infographic) and by topic.

This simple exercise will help you identify:

- What you already have
- What’s missing
- What can be improved or repurposed

With full visibility, you can build a clearer and more efficient content roadmap.

---

## 2. Remove Anything Outdated

Old content might no longer reflect your current services, audience needs, or industry trends.

Identify content that:

- References obsolete tools or services
- Targets an audience segment that’s shifted
- Relies on out-of-date data or trends

Where possible, update or repurpose these pieces. If that’s not an option, it’s okay to archive or remove them — and use them as inspiration for something new.

---

## 3. Repurpose Your Content

Great content shouldn’t go to waste. If a blog performed well, could it also work as:

- A LinkedIn carousel?
- A podcast talking point?
- A newsletter feature?

Repurposing helps you maximise ROI on existing work and ensures your ideas reach audiences across channels.

---

## 4. Speak to Your Audience

You don’t need to guess what content your audience wants — just ask.

Use tools like:

- Surveys and polls
- Social media comments and DMs
- Customer interviews
- Support tickets or FAQs

This insight helps you create content that answers real questions and solves relevant problems — improving engagement and performance.

---

## 5. Prioritise Content Creation

Now that your audit is complete, start building out your new plan.

Focus on:

- Key gaps in your content library
- Formats that resonate with your audience
- Topics that support your current business goals

Set realistic timelines for content delivery. Regular output matters more than perfect frequency — so build a strategy that your team can actually maintain.

---

## 6. Create Detailed Content Briefs

A strong brief saves time and keeps content consistent.

Your briefs should include:

- Target audience and stage of the funnel
- Objective of the content
- Primary and secondary keywords
- Suggested structure (titles, headers, CTA)

Detailed briefs help writers deliver the right message, tone, and style — reducing rounds of edits and content drift.

---

## 7. Maintain Your Strategy with Governance

Once your content strategy is refreshed, the key is to keep it up.

Schedule regular content reviews (every 3 to 6 months), and consider:

- Hiring freelancers to support when internal capacity dips
- Partnering with an external agency for strategy, writing, or design
- Building out a content calendar that includes backups or evergreen topics

With a little ongoing effort, you’ll never fall behind again.
