# How Can B2B Marketers Adapt To Gen-Z Buyers?

With Generation Z (Gen-Z) quickly emerging as a significant force in the workforce and the B2B buying landscape, businesses must recognise and adapt to their growing influence.

While this demographic currently makes up only 2% of B2B buyers, their impact is expected to grow significantly in the next decade. Together with Millennials, Gen-Z constitutes 64% of business buyers, with Millennials representing over half of all buyers.

With these significant demographic shifts, B2B marketers must adapt to engage Gen-Z buyers effectively. Their tech-savvy nature, preference for digital channels, and desire for authenticity pose unique challenges.

## Understanding Gen-Z Buyer Behaviour in B2B

Gen-Z buyers show distinct traits and preferences. B2B marketers must consider these characteristics to engage them effectively:

- **Tech-savvy**: They prefer self-guided digital experiences and making independent decisions online.
- **Aligned with ESG values**: Gen-Z cares deeply about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) responsibility.
- **Strong values**: Authenticity and trust are non-negotiable; any perceived insincerity is a turn-off.
- **Influenced by social media**: They trust peer opinions and influencer recommendations.

To resonate with this audience, brands need transparent messaging and must meet them on their preferred platforms.

## Transforming B2B Marketing for Gen-Z Engagement

Gen-Z expects content to be:

- **Visually engaging**
- **Culturally aware**
- **Personalised and bold**

Use humour, pop culture, and strong design to connect. Keep communication informal, especially across social and private groups. Authenticity builds loyalty.

## Leveraging Influencers and Social Media

Influencers are a major trust driver for Gen-Z. Collaborating with relevant, values-aligned influencers can:

- Enhance your credibility
- Extend your reach
- Drive engagement

Maintain a strong presence on Gen-Z's preferred platforms like **YouTube** (favoured by 88%) and **TikTok**. Tailor your content to platform dynamics and usage habits.

- Share behind-the-scenes insights
- Host live sessions
- Engage actively with comments

Combine this with **authentic storytelling** about your brand’s purpose and ESG commitments to forge emotional connections.

## Navigating the Changing B2B Landscape

Adapting to Gen-Z isn’t just about tactics — it’s about agility and intent.

> “Gen-Z are loyal to no brand… strong brands that get ESG strategy right… can win.” – *McKinsey*

Stay flexible. Keep researching. Monitor their evolving behaviours. And remember — what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow.

Studying successful case studies from other B2B brands can also help you build strategies rooted in real-world results.
