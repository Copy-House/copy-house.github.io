# Why business marketing cannot succeed without content

Did you know that content marketing costs 62% less than traditional marketing strategies and generates three times as many leads? Pretty impressive, right?

But, despite these amazing gains, 26% of content marketers say they still struggle to convert their campaigns into leads. Why is this?

Creating attention-grabbing content is one thing, but turning interaction into conversions is a whole different ballgame. Many businesses face this challenge, so how do you cut through the noise and make your content work harder for you?

In this article, we dive into why business marketing simply can't succeed without content, as well as how nailing your content strategy can take your marketing efforts from "meh" to magnetic. Read on to learn more.

## The rise of the empowered customer

We live in an era where consumers are empowered with the world's information at their fingertips. Every claim a company makes, every industry competitor, and every customer that feels compelled to write a brand review, is all instantly accessible.  
This means that organisations can no longer hide behind polished billboard ads and carefully crafted PR campaigns. They must embrace the empowered customer's insatiable hunger for authentic messages — or risk losing them to brands that value Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T).

Google's focus on E-E-A-T directly impacts how well marketing campaigns rank in organic search, and social media sites — and consumer behaviours have followed suit.

Here’s an overview of E-E-A-T content characteristics:

- **Experience**: Demonstrates first-hand knowledge, including customer testimonials, tutorials, FAQs and product demos.
- **Expertise**: Offers in-depth, educational or technical content that showcases deep understanding of the topic.
- **Authoritativeness**: Adds credibility through industry studies, expert quotes, affiliations or guest posts on reputable websites.
- **Trustworthiness**: Delivers accurate, up-to-date, and transparent content, with clear contact info and editorial standards.

These principles guide customers through the digital marketing funnel — the journey from awareness to conversion and beyond.

## Top-of-the-funnel content: Building awareness and engaging your audience

Building a strong online presence begins with top-of-funnel content to generate brand awareness across organic and social channels. According to recent studies, 87% of B2B brands have used content marketing to build awareness in the past year. Key formats include:

- **Informative blog posts**: Optimised long-reads (700–3,000 words) help build credibility and trust. Including relevant keywords can increase click-through rates by up to 45%.
- **Social media posts**: Short, engaging posts (especially on LinkedIn and Instagram) are perfect for reaching new audiences. According to LinkedIn, 84% of B2B buyers now use social media to inform their decisions.
- **Infographics and video**: Visual content distils complex information and boosts reach. Forbes reports that 87% of marketers credit video for driving awareness and growth.

## Middle-of-the-funnel content: Nurturing leads and building relationships

Once your brand is on a prospect’s radar, content should focus on providing deeper value to encourage them through the funnel. Consider:

- **eBooks and whitepapers**: Long-form gated content (2,000–20,000 words) showcases E-E-A-T. Notably, 76% of B2B buyers will share their details for a whitepaper — versus only 19% for video.
- **Email marketing campaigns**: Personalised email newsletters keep leads engaged. Targeted campaigns generate 2.5× more clicks and are 6× more likely to convert.

## Bottom-of-the-funnel content: Attracting conversions and lifetime customers

At the final stage of the funnel, content should build confidence and prompt action — while laying the groundwork for loyalty. Proven formats include:

- **Case studies and customer testimonials**: Nothing builds trust like real stories. 89% of marketers cite testimonials as their most effective content for converting leads.
