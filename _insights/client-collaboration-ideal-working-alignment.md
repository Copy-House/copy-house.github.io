# Client collaboration: achieving the ideal working alignment

Around half of all brands currently outsource some, or all, of their content to outsourced agencies, delivering them a host of benefits.

Firstly, these clients get access to copywriters and designers, all boasting years of experience working with brands in their industry. Secondly, brands can alleviate the burden of creating ‘always on’ content, allowing internal marketing teams to focus their time on more strategic tasks.

Yet, survey findings from SEMrush reveal that 41% of companies are less than satisfied with the quality of outsourced content. This general dissatisfaction may be due to several reasons, including insufficient briefing materials, a lack of consideration for the target audience, or even a complete absence of relevant keywords.

Still, these criticisms all boil down to one key issue: a misalignment in communication hindering the project’s success.

Here at CopyHouse, we have a tried-and-tested method for staying in tune with our client’s needs and bridging communication gaps. This article looks at how we overcome client collaboration challenges and build productive long-term relationships.

## Client collaboration challenges in achieving ideal working alignment

### Understanding the client’s value proposition

Content marketing agencies work with a wide range of clients and may have extensive experience writing for specific industries.

But if the product or service is highly complex, some agencies may struggle to grasp the more technical aspects of the value proposition, potentially hindering their ability to create persuasive content.

To ensure alignment in client understanding, content marketers may need time to thoroughly research the company, using previous content examples and in-depth client discovery workshops to get on track. A detailed brief will also help copywriters hit the ground running on the first assignment.

### Agreeing on the project scope

Clients may not always be fully aware of the scope of a project or what they want the deliverables to look like in terms of word count, imagery, or whether the content would benefit from an infographic. Misalignment like this can lead to scope creep — where tasks are added without proper planning.

Defining clear project boundaries from the outset helps content marketing agencies plan workflows and timelines efficiently. Most importantly, it prevents over-promising and under-delivering.

For example, suppose desk research of a niche topic is agreed upon, but the copywriter exhausts online sources without finding useful insight. In that case, they can ask the client to expand the scope to include an expert interview. This enables the agency to deliver credible, authoritative content that resonates with the target audience.

### Communication barriers

Poor communication can take many forms — missed deadlines, unclear feedback, or misunderstandings about required content. To avoid these issues, both sides must establish strong communication protocols.

Agencies should stay open to ongoing feedback and clarify content direction whenever needed. Likewise, clients should be proactive in sharing internal changes — whether it's an updated product, a shift in tone, or organisational restructuring — so content stays current.

That said, respecting confidentiality is essential. If certain details can’t be disclosed, clients should communicate this early to establish trust and appropriate boundaries.

### Achieving a consistent tone of voice

Many clients turn to content marketing agencies to help them craft a cohesive and consistent tone of voice. However, if this isn’t established early, the agency may default to analysing past content and making educated guesses — which can lead to misalignment.

At CopyHouse, we run brand messaging workshops that combine competitor analysis, audience insights, and SEO research to build or refine your brand’s identity. After the session, we share a findings report so your internal teams can align around a consistent tone across all marketing activity.

### Handling revisions and feedback

While the goal is to get content right on the first draft, most projects require refinement — especially early in the working relationship.

If the feedback is minor, clients can leave comments in the shared document. However, if more than 50% of the content needs reworking, it’s often better to jump on a call to discuss where it’s missing the mark.

At CopyHouse, we offer two rounds of revisions to ensure feedback is captured and content evolves to meet expectations. If needed, our content director or account manager can also step in to help steer the creative process in the right direction.
