# Content Creation: In-House vs Agency

Content creation is an essential part of any good marketing strategy. But who is ultimately responsible for creating it? Generally speaking, you have two options:

- **In-house**: Your company creates its own content. In larger or mid-sized businesses, this would usually be a job for your marketing team.
- **Agency**: You outsource your content creation to an expert content agency, who might also take care of things like content strategy and branding.

Both strategies come with benefits and drawbacks, so it can be tough to pick the best option for you. However, the importance of content creation means that making the right choice is crucial.

Read on for our analysis of both in-house and agency content creation. We’ll highlight their advantages and disadvantages to help you make an informed decision.

## Agency

### Advantages

**Expertise**  
An accredited content marketing agency can offer incredible insights into how to build the right kind of content for your industry. You can rely on an agency to provide qualified marketing talent, saving you from intensive recruitment drives. Most agencies also bring a broad skill set—strategy, design, SEO, content creation, and personal branding.

**Flexibility**  
Content creation takes time, and small to mid-sized businesses may not have enough staff to make in-house content creation feasible. Hiring an agency allows your team to focus on core responsibilities while improving agility.

**Scalability**  
Using an agency means you can scale your marketing efforts up or down as needed—ideal for fluctuating workloads or growth periods—without long-term staffing commitments.

### Disadvantages

**Location**  
Time zones can be a challenge when working with agencies, especially internationally. That said, many content agencies (like CopyHouse) are used to working across regions and have systems in place to manage time differences smoothly.

**Briefings**  
Getting the best results requires clear and detailed instructions. If communication is vague, the content may miss the mark—so investing time in strong briefing processes is a must.

## In-House

### Advantages

**Cost**  
On paper, in-house content creation can be more cost-effective than agency fees. You also get better transparency over how time and budget are spent. But bear in mind, hiring and upskilling staff also comes with costs.

**Accessibility**  
Your marketing team is just a Slack message or desk visit away. Brainstorms, edits, and updates can happen in real-time, which makes collaboration easier.

**Consistency**  
Internal teams know your brand voice, tone, and values inside out. This makes it easier to create consistent content across all channels, especially when the team has been part of building the brand narrative.

### Disadvantages

**Recruitment**  
Hiring the right in-house talent takes time and money. On top of standard interviews, you might need to assess portfolios or writing samples, and it may take months to fill a role.

**Experience**  
In-house teams may lack specialised skills in areas like content strategy, technical SEO, or design. Agencies bring those capabilities straight out of the box, helping you compete at a higher level without long onboarding cycles.
