# Content Marketing Consultancy: Why is It Important?

Consultancy is an enormous industry, and most large companies will have at least a few consultants on hand to provide expert guidance about a topic or advise on strategic planning for a particular business function. Consultants are most effective when they’re highly knowledgeable about a complicated subject for which you employ few internal experts; as such, content marketing consultancy is a huge industry.

In this article, we’ll look at what a content marketing consultancy is, and what one of these specialised consultants will do should you employ them. We’ll also discuss the benefits and advantages of content marketing consultancy. Read on for more.

## What is Content Marketing Consultancy?

In short, content marketing consultancy is a service where someone — typically an experienced marketing expert — provides advice to your company on creating a content strategy that educates, entertains, and triggers action from your specific audience.

You might gain consultancy as part of a content agency’s offering, especially if they’re producing content for you. However, strategic advice may incur additional costs.

You should consider content marketing consultancy if:

- You lack the internal expertise or budget to create a high-quality campaign or build a full-time team.
- You have a team but lack specialism in targeting specific industries (e.g. fintech).
- You’re unhappy with current results and need help understanding analytics and direction.

## What Does a Content Marketing Consultant Do?

### Builds Content Strategy

Rather than producing content blindly, a consultant helps shape an overarching strategy. They identify pillar topics and recommend the best content formats — from whitepapers to email campaigns and social media.

### Data Analysis and Key Metrics

Sometimes, you don’t need more content — just better insight. A consultant can review analytics, introduce new tools, and help you understand what’s working, what’s not, and what to do next.

### Explores New Content Options

Even top-performing brands get stuck. Consultants can breathe new life into your approach by recommending new formats like videos, podcasts, or interactive webinars.

### Trains Your Internal Team

If you already have a marketing team, a consultant can upskill them. For instance, they might introduce a customer-obsessed mindset and offer hands-on training in more human-centred marketing.

## The Benefits of Content Marketing Consultancy

By working with a marketing consultant, you’ll likely see:

- A better return on investment (ROI) from marketing
- Higher B2B lead generation
- More time for senior leaders as the consultant leads marketing strategy
- Improved search engine visibility
- Stronger website authority and performance

> Tip: Choosing the right consultant is critical. Not all agencies or experts will be the right fit — make sure they understand your industry, audience, and goals.
