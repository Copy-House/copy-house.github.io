# Creating Personalised Experiences with Marketing

Personalisation is the hot topic of marketing. With **80% of consumers** stating they are more likely to buy from brands offering a personalised service, and **55% of marketing professionals** claiming personalisation increases conversion rates and promotes growth, it’s no wonder it has become essential to every marketing strategy.

In the [Technology CMO Outlook Report](https://www.copyhouse.io/insights/technology-cmo-outlook-report), Chapter 1 discusses the importance of personalised marketing and how tech experts have adapted to their consumers during and after the pandemic.

## Creating Hyper-Personalised Content

Understanding your audience is essential. By creating hyper-personalised content, you’re showing them you care. In fact, **86% of consumers** are more likely to support a brand that feels authentic rather than one that blasts them with generic content.

Oliver Pilgerstorfer, CMO at IFS, shared how COVID forced them to dig deeper than just going digital. They discovered that their audience was spread across various stages of the buying journey — some retreating, others restructuring — and their messaging had to reflect those nuances.

Hyper-personalised marketing improves loyalty. During uncertain times, brands that adapt to both the downfalls and opportunities faced by their audience are more likely to retain customer trust. Although AI tools provide valuable data, it’s up to marketers to shape meaningful, empathetic strategies in response.

> “As audiences have become more savvy, diverse and informed, we recognise that executives want more than to be talked to – they want an experience that feels both personal and authentic. We must remain agile, customer-focused and aware that things change, and we need to be prepared to change too.”  
> – Gemma Davies, Senior Director of Global ABM & CXO Engagement, ServiceNow

## The Importance of Human Empathy

AI tools have revolutionised personalisation — offering real-time analysis and behavioural insights — but empathy can’t be automated.

> “With companies cutting back, factories closing and employees across many industries getting furloughed, we had to be mindful of our marketing messages and lead with empathy.”  
> – Maya Price, Marketing Director, SAP

Even during automation, marketers need to assess where customers are emotionally and professionally. Some companies offered free trials or lowered prices. Others leaned on [thought leadership content](https://www.copyhouse.io/insights/how-to-become-a-thought-leader-in-tech) to stay relevant and helpful.

## Moving Forward Post-Pandemic

The pandemic transformed work — **46.6% of UK workers** shifted to remote work, and **65%** want to keep that flexibility. With audiences more accustomed to virtual experiences, brands must embrace hybrid strategies that cater to both digital-first and in-person preferences.

Hyper-personalised content remains vital. Some businesses flourished; others struggled. So, marketing messages must reflect each customer’s context — there’s no one-size-fits-all.

Yet, only **9% of marketers** have a true hyper-personalised strategy in place, and **62%** are only starting to talk about it. That’s a missed opportunity. To maintain relevance, businesses must act now.

> “I think that the biggest challenge for marketers is going to be finding the right balance in their marketing mix. Yes, people will still want to travel for certain things, but it’s unlikely that events will be anything like they were in 2019. So, I think making sure that we adapt quickly to how people behave will be our biggest challenge.”  
> – Oliver Pilgerstorfer, Chief Marketing Officer at IFS
