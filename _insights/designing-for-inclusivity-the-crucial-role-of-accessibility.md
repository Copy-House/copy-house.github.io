# Designing for Inclusivity: The Crucial Role of Accessibility

As children, many of us were told that “words will never hurt you.” Yet, as we grow older and (hopefully) wiser, we understand that words can and do hurt.

At CopyHouse, we recognise the responsibility of using language and design with care. The importance of **accessibility** and **inclusion** goes far beyond copy — it’s central to user experience (UX) and content design at every stage.

To dive deeper into how inclusive design works in practice, we spoke with our resident Content Designer, Patrick Tu, about how to create visually appealing content that’s accessible to everyone.

## What is Inclusive Content Design?

Before jumping into “inclusive” content design, it’s useful to define what content creation actually involves.

From a content and UX designer's perspective, content is a **problem-solving exercise**. It requires research, audits, and identifying user pain points — whether you're updating a webpage or building an entire website from scratch.

Inclusive content design means creating content with **accessibility**, **equality**, and **usability** at its core. It aims to serve people from diverse industries, abilities, languages, and cultures — making information and interaction seamless for all.

## What Are Examples of Great Inclusive Content and Design?

Inclusive design doesn’t just serve minority groups — it benefits **everyone**.

Take the **Nike Go FlyEase** as an example. Marketed as the first hands-free sneaker, it's a product that supports people with limited mobility without excluding others. By making the product appealing to all, Nike promoted accessibility **without limitation**.

In the digital space, **Salesforce** is a great example. Their CRM solutions cater to businesses of all shapes and sizes. The **Salesforce website** uses jargon-free, inclusive language and graphics that speak to a broad audience, with a user-friendly design that feels approachable regardless of industry.

## How Can You Design Content to Be Inclusive?

Like all strong design practices, inclusive content starts by understanding your audience. Ask:

- Why this?
- Why now?
- What barriers could this audience face?

At CopyHouse, we advise clients to follow **WCAG 2.1** accessibility guidelines. That means planning time for user testing, and ensuring your website performs well across various breakpoints — desktop, mobile, and tablet.

Inclusive design should prioritise **function over flash**. While bold designs may look impressive, accessibility requires simplicity, clarity, and thoughtful user journeys.

Ultimately, inclusivity isn’t a checklist — it’s a **continuous process**.
