# Every Content Marketers’ Worst Nightmares

Ever wonder what keeps our copywriters and content design team up at night? In light of Halloween, we’re pulling back the curtain and sharing the content marketing nightmares that haunt even the most seasoned pros.

Here are the scariest marketing fails our team *begs* you to avoid when crafting content for your technology or FinTech brand.

---

## 1. Clickbait Titles 🎣

Clickbait titles are engineered to exploit curiosity, but they rarely deliver substance. These emotionally-charged headlines may win the click, but they also earn your brand a poor reputation — and a high bounce rate.

That bounce rate? It tells search engines your content isn’t worth ranking. In short: clickbait kills your SEO *and* your credibility.

**Avoid it. Always.**

---

## 2. Keyword Stuffing 🧟‍♂️

There’s nothing more chilling than a paragraph like this:

> “Our FinTech marketing services will help your FinTech marketing strategy succeed. Trust our FinTech marketing expertise.”

Terrifying, right?

Keyword stuffing ruins readability and leads to penalisation by search engines. Tools like **Semrush** recommend:

- Prioritising *quality* over quantity in keyword selection
- Increasing word count for natural keyword spread
- Writing for humans, not just algorithms

---

## 3. Inventing Words or Phrases 🧪

Trying to stand out with made-up terms or quirky phrases might feel creative, but without clear audience alignment, you risk alienating readers or undermining the professionalism of your brand.

Wit can work — but only when it’s backed by clarity and relevance.

---

## 4. Long, Boring, and Bland Content 💤

Even the best insights can fall flat if presented without structure or visual flair.

- The average attention span is 6.8 seconds
- Poorly structured or mobile-incompatible layouts will drive users away
- 54.8% of web traffic now comes from mobile

Design and copy must work together to keep your content digestible, engaging and easy to read across devices.

---

## 5. Cheesy Sales Language 🧀

Somewhere between *“Don’t you want to save money?”* and *“What’s it gonna take to get you to buy today?”*, your readers will run for the hills.

Avoid cliché phrases and overly pushy CTAs. They’re dated, unconvincing, and often patronising.

Modern B2B buyers want insight and value — not pressure.

---

## 6. Trying to Speak to Everyone 🌍

“If you try to reach everyone, you’ll reach no one.”

Nothing sends a shiver down a copywriter’s spine quite like generic, one-size-fits-all content.

Instead, create a **customer avatar** — a detailed persona that reflects your ideal client. Use that to:

- Shape your tone of voice
- Tailor your content formats
- Solve specific pain points

The more specific your audience, the more impactful your content.
