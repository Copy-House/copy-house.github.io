## What Is a Marketing Infographic?

As the name suggests, an infographic is a visual presentation of data, information, or research. Marketing infographics allow brands to share their insights and research in a more appealing and digestible way — especially for time-poor audiences.

Infographics can highlight original research, industry surveys, helpful stats, or a step-by-step breakdown of a topic. Above all, they aim to offer valuable insights to your audience in a memorable, visual format.

## How to Create an Infographic in 5 Easy Steps

### Step 1: Pick a Relevant Topic

Start with a clear goal in mind. Ask:
- What research would your audience value?
- What topics are timely and relevant?
- What action or outcome do you want?

This clarity will help you structure your infographic with purpose and align it with broader marketing goals.

### Step 2: Compile Research

Once you have a topic, begin collecting credible, recent research — either internally via analytics and surveys or from trusted third-party sources.

Always link or cite your data where appropriate to build trust.

### Step 3: Write the Copy

Use:
- Concise, punchy language
- Clear section headers
- Stats or short statements in text boxes

Avoid overloading the design with text. Leave white space for visuals and flow. Proofread thoroughly to ensure accuracy and polish.

### Step 4: Design the Infographic

You can use tools like **Canva**, **Piktochart**, or **Adobe Illustrator** — or work with professionals like **CopyHouse** for a polished finish.

Design tips:
- Stick to brand colours and fonts
- Use hierarchy with size and type
- Guide the eye with layout and flow
- Keep it clutter-free and structured

### Step 5: Share the Infographic

Distribute your infographic across:
- Social media
- Blog posts
- Email newsletters
- Partner or third-party platforms

Repurpose sections as standalone visuals and stagger your promotion to maximise reach. Always measure performance to refine future content.
