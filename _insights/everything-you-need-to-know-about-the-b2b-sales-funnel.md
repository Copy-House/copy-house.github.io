# Everything You Need To Know About The B2B Sales Funnel

We’ve all been there. When we’re so close to making a sale, but something goes wrong, and another potential lead falls through the cracks. 

This is especially heartbreaking in the B2B world, where consumers are not as impulsive, and it can take from 6 to 12 months to convert a lead into a buyer. 

However, that’s where the sales funnel comes in.

## What is a Sales Funnel?

In simple terms, a sales funnel is the journey your potential customers go through to transform from leads to buyers. 

By creating a sales funnel, you can understand what your prospects are thinking at each stage of their journey. You're then able to shape their experience by providing the right content at the right time. 

Understanding your audience and their journey is a brilliant way to develop and get the most out of your B2B content marketing strategy.

## What are the Sales Funnel Stages?

The typical B2B sales funnel consists of three key stages:

- **Top of Funnel (The Awareness Stage)** – This content is all about bringing in leads.  
- **Middle of Funnel (The Consideration Stage)** – This stage is about nurturing leads and showing them why your brand is worth the investment.  
- **Bottom of Funnel (The Purchase Stage)** – This stage seals the deal and transforms leads into buyers and brand advocates.  

Let’s break down what content works best at each stage:

## Awareness Stage

This is where people first become aware of your product or service. Your goal here is to **attract and educate**.

### Content suggestions:
- **Long-form content** like blog articles and eBooks with strong SEO for organic traffic  
- **Short-form content** derived from your long-form pieces for social media  
- **Thought leadership posts** to spark conversation and demonstrate expertise  

Creating high-value, optimised content helps your brand rank and stay front of mind.

## Consideration Stage

Once you’ve introduced yourself, it’s time to nurture interest. This stage is about building trust and guiding leads towards conversion.

### Content suggestions:
- **Case studies** showing measurable results  
- **Drip email campaigns** that provide ongoing value  
- **Newsletters** with insights and updates  
- **Brand storytelling** to reinforce your values and connect emotionally  

Ask yourself:
- What makes our brand trustworthy?
- Do our values align with those of our audience?
- How can we prove our impact?

---

## Purchase Stage

This is the final step before conversion—when the lead is ready to buy. Now it’s time to reinforce confidence and offer personalised support.

### Content and tactics:
- **Follow-up emails** that answer final questions  
- **How-to guides** for onboarding or product use  
- **Personalised messaging** tailored to their journey  
- **Direct outreach**, including follow-up calls  
- **Exclusive events or demos**

> **Did you know?** 80% of sales require **five follow-up calls** after a meeting.  

You're not the only contender. A ‘**serve, not sell**’ mindset helps prospects feel supported—not pressured—during their decision-making process.
