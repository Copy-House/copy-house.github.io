Founded over a decade ago by digital accessibility champions Joe Devon and Jennifer Asuncion, GAAD has spotlighted the importance of designing with inclusivity in mind. And while developers often focus on accessible design standards — such as keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and colour contrast ratios — there’s another essential layer to accessibility that deserves equal attention: the content itself.

#### Accessibility Is About More Than Design

Good accessible design sets the stage. But even the most technically compliant website can fall short if the language, structure, or intent of the content isn’t equally inclusive.

For someone using a screen reader, overly complex sentence structures or jargon-heavy copy can be just as obstructive as a missing alt tag. For users with cognitive impairments or learning disabilities, ambiguous instructions or a lack of clear hierarchy can create confusion.

Accessibility isn’t just about being *able* to reach the content — it’s about being able to understand, navigate, and act on it confidently. That’s where high-quality, inclusive content creation comes into play.

#### Content That Includes Everyone

To make digital experiences truly inclusive, content teams need to collaborate with UX and development from the outset. At CopyHouse, we apply key tenets to accessible content writing so that they will support inclusive design goals – something we encourage our clients to take on board:

* **Clarity is key**: Use plain language. Prioritise brevity and clarity over flair. Write as though every sentence is being read aloud — because for many users, it is.
* **Structure supports understanding**: Break content into manageable chunks. Use meaningful headings and subheadings that reflect page structure. Ensure lists, instructions, and CTAs follow a logical flow.
* **Alt text with intent**: Provide descriptive, useful image descriptions. Don’t just say “photo of person smiling” — contextualise why the image matters to the surrounding content.
* **Link with purpose**: Avoid vague phrases like “click here.” Instead, write links that clearly describe where they’ll take the user, e.g., “Read our accessibility policy.”
* **Test with assistive tech**: Ensure your written content actually works with screen readers, voice controls, and other accessibility tools — and adjust based on real feedback.

We’re proud to be working daily with our fellow Cohaesus Group companies such as [Moriyama](https://moriyama.co.uk/#), on digital projects that merge these disciplines of accessible content with the technical and social imperatives to bring the digital environment to life for everybody.

#### Making Inclusion a Content Standard

Accessibility isn’t a one-off audit or a box to tick. It’s an ongoing, evolving process — and content writers, strategists, and marketers have an integral role to play. By thinking inclusively at the copy level, we create experiences that aren’t just passable, but *meaningful* for all users.

As we mark GAAD, let’s remember: accessibility is a shared responsibility, and quality content is every bit as crucial as compliant code.
