# How LinkedIn supercharges your SEO strategy

LinkedIn, now boasting over 70 million businesses across 200 countries, has evolved from a professional networking platform into a marketing machine — offering unprecedented access to B2B buyers and the pulse of industry conversations.

Since its mid-2023 algorithm update, LinkedIn posts have been taking up more real estate on Google’s first page. B2B marketers are taking note: LinkedIn’s enhanced visibility significantly boosts organic SEO traffic. In fact, recent studies show that LinkedIn posts are 277% more effective for lead generation than content from X.com (formerly Twitter) or Facebook.

This article explores how LinkedIn can supercharge your SEO strategy — and offers actionable tips for making the most of it.

## What is LinkedIn SEO?

In 2023, LinkedIn rolled out new SEO functionality that allows users to add optimised titles and meta descriptions via the Publishing Menu.

By incorporating relevant keywords into publishing tags and body text, users make posts indexable by Google — improving visibility in search results. This makes LinkedIn an integral part of your broader SEO strategy.

As a result, marketers have significantly increased content output. Articles on LinkedIn’s advice pages jumped from 38,000 to 295,000 in the last 12 months, with traffic soaring from 73,000 to 1.2 million.

But simply reposting your blog’s “how-to” articles on LinkedIn won’t cut it. Since canonical tagging isn’t yet supported by Google, LinkedIn doesn’t recognise your site as the content’s original source. You need a refreshed SEO approach to turn LinkedIn into a lead-driving engine.

Here’s how.

## How to optimise your LinkedIn strategy to boost SEO performance

### Repurpose your existing content for LinkedIn SEO

Instead of copy-pasting blog content, add a new spin when posting to LinkedIn. Consider including:

- Timely industry news or commentary
- Quotes from expert interviews
- Updated data or examples

Always link back to the original content on your website to establish ownership and avoid duplication issues. Done right, repurposed content can remain discoverable and engaging for months.

### Harness long-tail and short-tail keywords

Blend both long- and short-tail keywords across your profile and content. Long-tail keywords help potential clients find your brand through search, while short-tail keywords improve your visibility on LinkedIn itself.

⚠️ Tip: 97% of visitors won’t click ‘See more’ on your About section, so lead with your most relevant keywords.

Avoid keyword stuffing — LinkedIn’s spam filters penalise overuse. Instead, focus on natural phrasing that mirrors how your audience speaks and searches.

### Activate Creator Mode to diversify your content

LinkedIn’s Creator Mode boosts content discoverability and unlocks new features like:

- **Newsletters**  
- **Live Streams** — which get 24x more comments than standard posts

Creator Mode also reshuffles your profile layout to prioritise high-value content. Use bold graphics and headlines that directly address your audience’s business challenges.

### Utilise LinkedIn Analytics to improve your SSI

Your **Social Selling Index (SSI)** is a key metric. Aim for a score of 70+ to show LinkedIn’s algorithm that you’re a trustworthy and active profile.

Users with high SSI scores enjoy up to 45% more visibility.

To boost your SSI:

- Reply to other users’ content
- Join relevant conversations
- Build relationships within your network

LinkedIn Analytics helps you identify which content resonates, so you can refine and repeat what works.

### Build your LinkedIn community and backlinks

Grow your audience with intention:

- Use tools like Hootsuite or Sprout Social to listen to conversations that matter
- Post content tailored to those insights
- Seek backlinks to your profile by collaborating with influencers or publishing to relevant industry pages

For example, you might co-host a LinkedIn Live session with a niche influencer or guest-write a tailored thought leadership piece for their audience.
