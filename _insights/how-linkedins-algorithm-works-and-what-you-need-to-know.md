# How LinkedIn‚Äôs algorithm works & what you need to know

LinkedIn is the titan of B2B marketing, with 91% of B2B marketers sharing content and 80% of social media-generated leads originating from the platform.

Despite its one billion-strong user base and 310 million monthly active users, there‚Äôs often a disconnect between what B2B marketers expect from the platform and how LinkedIn‚Äôs algorithm actually works.

While companies post frequently and invest heavily in content, average engagement rates still hover at just 1.1% per post.

Why? Because LinkedIn no longer rewards superficial reach. Instead, it prioritises **relevance, expertise, and relationship-building** over vanity metrics.

This article breaks down how the algorithm functions in 2025 and offers practical tips to align your content with LinkedIn‚Äôs values of professional growth and knowledge sharing.

## What B2B marketers need to know about the LinkedIn algorithm right now

Like Google, LinkedIn keeps its algorithmic secrets close. But savvy marketers and researchers have tested patterns, revealing key insights:

### LinkedIn is a recommendation engine

Your feed isn‚Äôt chronological ‚Äî it‚Äôs tailored. LinkedIn‚Äôs algorithm surfaces posts it believes you‚Äôre likely to interact with, based on:

- Your interests
- Your previous behaviour
- Who and what you engage with

### Every post is sorted into one of three categories:

1. **Great content**: Relevant, valuable, high-dwell-time posts that spark conversation. These are promoted more widely ‚Äî especially when comments exceed 15 words.
2. **Low-quality content**: Vague, overly self-promotional, or too broad to connect with specific audiences.
3. **Spam**: Violations of LinkedIn‚Äôs community guidelines ‚Äî including overt sales, emoji spam, connection farming, or engagement pods.

### The ‚ÄúGolden Hour‚Äù test

When you post, LinkedIn shows your content to a small test group for 60 minutes. If engagement is strong, your reach increases. If not, the post fades.

‚ö†Ô∏è Tactic to avoid: Artificially boosting engagement (e.g. asking colleagues to like/comment immediately). LinkedIn now penalises engagement pods and suspicious behaviour.

## Tips for adapting B2B marketing strategies for LinkedIn

### Short-form video is king

Native LinkedIn videos drive **5x more engagement** and **20x more shares** than external links.

üí° Neil Patel recommends:

- **Short videos** (40‚Äì46 seconds) with 1‚Äì2 sentence captions and a strong hook
- **Educational long-form videos** (3‚Äì4 mins) with captions under 291 characters

### Prioritise social search and relevance

LinkedIn now uses **semantic search** to show relevant content ‚Äî hashtags matter less than intent.

- Optimise for **long-tail keywords**, but focus more on **industry terminology** and educational value
- High-quality posts can remain discoverable for months through **suggested post feeds**

### Foster authentic engagement

LinkedIn values **meaningful interactions**, not surface-level clicks. Encourage engagement by:

- Leaving thoughtful comments on relevant content  
- Asking open-ended questions in your posts  
- Joining groups and connecting with peers in your niche  

Avoid one-word replies. Instead, reply with context, insights, or follow-up questions to extend the conversation.

### Time your posts to maximise the Golden Hour

Use LinkedIn Analytics or third-party tools (like Hootsuite or Sprout Social) to discover when your audience is most active.

üìÖ **Best UK times to post** (according to Sprout Social):  
**Tuesday to Thursday, 10am‚Äì12pm** ‚Äî but test your own audience for accuracy.
