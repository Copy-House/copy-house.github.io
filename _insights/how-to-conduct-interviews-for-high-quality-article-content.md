# How to Conduct Interviews for High-Quality Article Content

High-quality content is vital for brands that want to stand out and engage their target audiences. In the years following the pandemic, interview content has emerged as a powerful format to achieve these goals. According to a 2023 survey of marketers, **25% of brands are experimenting with expert interviews** in their content strategy and seeing great results.

This shift is largely due to increased demand for authenticity, as audiences crave genuine connections and insights in an era where they are inundated with information.

An expert interview adds credibility to your content and aligns with Google's **E-E-A-T framework** (expertise, experience, authority, trustworthiness). These qualities not only make your article more likely to rank well on Google, but also make your messaging more memorable — encouraging shares and engagement from like-minded thought leaders.

## Selecting Interviewees with Expertise and Experience

Choose individuals who can provide **genuine social proof** and show the real-world value of your service — beyond testimonials or reviews. Look for those with industry experience and a track record of solving the same problems your audience faces. 

Importantly, don’t shy away from nuance. A thoughtful, balanced interview carries more weight than glowing endorsements.

When you’ve identified strong candidates, send a tailored outreach message that highlights how the interview benefits them too — such as increased visibility, brand alignment, or new reach.

---

## Establish Authority Through Extensive Background Research

Thorough research shows respect for your interviewee and ensures the interview is insightful. Look into their past work, opinions, speaking engagements, and recent projects. This prep helps you move beyond surface-level questions and dig into what matters most to your audience.

Equally, research your topic to find gaps your interview can fill. When you offer value that competitors don’t, your content earns trust and attention.

---

## Provide Your Questions in Advance

Sharing interview questions beforehand allows your interviewee to prepare richer, more meaningful answers — especially when it comes to details like performance metrics, ROI or success stories.

Being transparent also builds trust and shows professionalism. Just be careful not to bias responses by “leading” them toward a preferred viewpoint. Help them understand your goals, but let their voice shine through authentically.

---

## Capture Personal Experiences During the Interview

Focus on creating a **conversational, open environment** during the interview. Ask follow-up questions, explore new tangents, and invite them to elaborate when needed.

Listen for stories, metaphors or examples — these add human depth to otherwise technical content. And when possible, preserve their tone of voice in the final article to maintain relatability and authenticity.

---

## Let Your Interviewee Review the Final Piece

Before publishing, allow the interviewee to review how their words have been used. This not only ensures accuracy, but builds long-term trust. If they’re happy, they’re more likely to share your content with their own network — extending its reach.

Encourage them to repurpose your article or pull quotes for their own marketing activity. When content is mutually beneficial, it performs better.

---

## Maximise the Value of Your Interview Content

Expert interviews offer more than just written articles. Consider repurposing them across formats such as:

- **Podcasts or webinars** using the original audio
- **Social video snippets** for LinkedIn, TikTok or Instagram
- **Infographics or quote cards** to visualise key takeaways
- **Blog series** or email campaigns based on episode-style segmentation

This multiplies your return on effort and ensures your insights reach more people, more often.
