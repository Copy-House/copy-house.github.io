Did you know that only [32%](https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/fintech-trust-awareness) of consumers trust financial technologies?

Marketing FinTech brands is challenging as consumers often perceive the financial industry as 'untrustworthy' due to a lack of education, the pace of technological advancement, and concerns around data security.

As a result, FinTech brands are frequently misunderstood and carry a reputation that undermines their credibility.

As marketers, it’s our job to position FinTech brands as trustworthy, credible, and transparent. But despite these efforts, building customer confidence remains a significant challenge.

So, what can FinTech marketers do to shift perceptions and spotlight the value of their offerings?

In this TechTalk, our host **Stuart Found** sat down with:

- **Ani Petrova**, Founder of [The Fintech Marketing Hub](https://www.fintechmarketinghub.com/)
- **Helen Owen**, VP of Marketing at [Tribe Payments](https://www.tribepayments.com/)

Together, they explored how FinTechs can build meaningful customer trust through education and authenticity.

## Building Trust in FinTech by Educating Your Target Audience

A primary reason people don’t trust FinTech brands is simply because they don’t understand them. The complexity of FinTech products and services creates a communication gap — one that marketers must bridge if they’re to earn their audience’s confidence.

> “Educating your target audience is needed from FinTechs to ensure the end customer and anyone along the chain fully understands what you’re offering and how it works. You must do this without boring them with the technical details…”  
> — *Helen Owen, Tribe Payments*

Educating your audience is especially powerful when paired with content marketing. Content gives FinTechs the ability to clarify, reassure and engage — all at scale.

> “Educating your target audience is probably the most cost-effective marketing tactic out there... To communicate the value proposition of your FinTech, content marketing is needed.”  
> — *Ani Petrova, The Fintech Marketing Hub*

## Common Mistakes Made When Marketing FinTech

Especially for FinTech startups, some missteps are inevitable. But there are a few common ones to avoid as early as possible:

### 1. **Not Understanding Your Audience**

Failing to clearly define your customer avatar and tailor your strategy around them can lead to wasted time and marketing spend. Customer-centric messaging begins with deep audience understanding.

Explore our [B2B sales funnel guide](https://www.copyhouse.io/insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-b2b-sales-funnel) to better understand content needs at every stage.

### 2. **Overselling Your Solution**

Overselling might seem like a quick win, but it can backfire — especially in an industry already battling trust issues.

> “My biggest champion area is honesty and being completely clear in what you offer. If you oversell... you can cause reputational damage.”  
> — *Helen Owen*

Setting realistic expectations and delivering on them builds long-term brand equity and customer confidence.
