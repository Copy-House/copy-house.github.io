# How to Humanise B2B Content

Sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind every organisation are real-life people with genuine emotions. This is especially true in the corporate world, where we can become immersed in business jargon and overlook the art of storytelling and relatable humour.

However, businesses today increasingly recognise the importance of humanising their content. Moving away from the traditional corporate tone and adopting a more authentic approach can have a profound impact on audience engagement, brand perception, and overall marketing success.

In this blog post, we'll explore what’s causing this shift away from conservative language and help you to understand the benefits of adding a human touch to your B2B (business-to-business) content.

## From Conservative to Conversational: The Shifting Dynamic of B2B Content

Traditionally, B2B content was characterised by formal language, technical jargon, and a focus on features and specifications. It was believed that, in order to convey a sense of professionalism and authority, a conservative tone was required across all business content.

Yet in recent years, there’s been a noticeable shift in B2B content, from the often-staid, traditionalist tone to a more conversational approach. Businesses are recognising the importance of engaging and connecting with their customers on a more personal level.

So, what has sparked this change?

### Evolving Decision-Making

In the past, decisions were made primarily by senior executives who preferred a professional tone that focused on technical detail.

Today, however, organisations encourage decision-making across all levels. Deloitte reports that 87% of organisations now empower staff closest to the issue to make key decisions, valuing *diversity of thought* over hierarchy.

### Generational Shifts

With millennials and Gen Z rapidly moving into leadership roles — millennials are expected to make up 75% of the global workforce by 2025 — the expectation for communication has shifted. These generations prefer brands that are authentic, personable and transparent.

### The Social Media Effect

Social media has accelerated the trend toward conversational tone in business content. As platforms favour more casual and engaging interactions, B2B marketers have started to mirror that tone in their campaigns to foster dialogue and accessibility.

## The Benefits of Humanising B2B Content

### Build Audience Connection

Humanised content fosters emotional connection. An authentic and approachable voice allows your brand to resonate with real people. Storytelling and light humour can create a sense of familiarity that encourages customer loyalty.

### Encourage Interaction

When your tone is more conversational, audiences feel comfortable engaging. Relatable stories and human-first messaging prompt responses — from comments to direct messages — which helps keep your brand top of mind.

### Stand Out from Competitors

In a saturated B2B market, it’s easy to blend in. But brands that sound human are more memorable. With 88% of consumers citing authenticity as a key reason they support a brand, ditching jargon and sharing stories can help differentiate your messaging.

### Enhance Shareability

Relatable, authentic content performs better on digital platforms. Content that sparks emotion or makes people think is more likely to be shared — helping to boost brand visibility and amplify reach.
