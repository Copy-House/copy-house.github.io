# How to Refresh Your Content to Improve Your SEO Rankings

Have you noticed that your website content isn’t ranking as highly as it used to? Perhaps you’re looking for ways to drive more SEO traffic to your website, but are struggling to find the time to write a whole load of new articles and website content.

Despite what some experts may tell you, it’s not always about writing loads and loads of content, but also taking a look at your existing copy and giving it a bit of a refresh.

We always advise that our clients get the most out of content that has already been created and make it work as hard as it can. Going over your existing articles and updating the content where necessary can make a huge difference to how search engines read the information and encourage more traffic to be driven to your website.

## Why You Should Refresh Your Content

There are many reasons why your content might need updating — or it could be a mix of all of them. Here are some key benefits:

### 1. Drive More Traffic to Your Website

Creating content that’s more readable, useful and accurate helps search engines like Google to better understand and rank it — making it easier for people to find.

### 2. Improve Your User’s Experience

Engaging content keeps readers on your site longer. When refreshing content, think about what your audience is actually looking for and how you can add value.

### 3. Become a Trusted Source of Information

Search engine rankings reward valid and valuable information. Keeping your content up-to-date positions your brand as a credible, go-to source.

### 4. Stay Ahead of Your Competitors

Your competitors are optimising too. Stay competitive by keeping track of what’s working in your industry and continuously improving your own content in response.

### 5. Keep On Track with Google Updates

Google frequently updates its algorithms. The 2022 Helpful Content update, for example, prioritises people-first content. Refreshing content helps you stay compliant and visible.

## How to Decide What Content to Update First

Here’s how to prioritise:

- **Pages that once performed well**: These might now be outranked by competitors.
- **Top-ranking pages**: Refresh them before performance dips.
- **High-potential pages**: Content with strong insights that hasn’t performed well could benefit most from an update.

## What Information Should You Update?

Once you’ve identified the right content to update, focus on these key elements:

### 1. Keywords

Are your keywords still relevant? Search trends shift, so you may need to update your keyword strategy for better alignment with current user intent.

### 2. Stats, Facts & Figures

Outdated or broken links erode trust. Replace them with accurate, up-to-date sources and verify the credibility of everything you cite.

### 3. Layout

Even minor changes like adding headers, bullet points, or simplifying language can significantly improve readability and SEO performance.
