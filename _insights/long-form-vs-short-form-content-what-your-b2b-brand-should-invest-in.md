# Long Form vs Short Form Content – What Your B2B Brand Should Invest In

When it comes to creating a strategic B2B content marketing strategy, you must incorporate different forms of content depending on what stage of the sales funnel your target audience is in.

Long-form and short-form content both serve different purposes and can push your audience through the sales funnel, transforming them from leads to buyers.

This article will go through long-form vs short-form content and decipher what they entail, why you should use them and most importantly, whether you’re using them in the right way.

## What Is Short-Form Content?

Short-form content typically has a word count of up to 1,200 words. It’s perfect for:

- Blog posts  
- News bulletins  
- Drip emails or newsletters  
- Infographics  
- Social media posts  
- Landing pages

### Pros of Short-Form Content

- Quick and easy to consume  
- Direct and to the point  
- Ideal for answering specific questions  
- Easier to produce and more mobile-friendly

### Cons of Short-Form Content

- Lacks depth for complex topics  
- Can become repetitive  
- Prone to quick obsolescence  
- Harder to repurpose than long-form content

Short-form content works particularly well on social media or as teasers for longer content. Use it to spark interest, then lead users to more in-depth content if they want to learn more.

## What Is Long-Form Content?

Any content over 1,200 words typically counts as long-form. Common formats include:

- In-depth blog posts or case studies  
- White papers  
- eBooks  
- Pillar pages  
- Comprehensive guides or tutorials

### Pros of Long-Form Content

- Stronger SEO performance  
- More keyword opportunities  
- Generates backlinks  
- Positions your brand as a thought leader  
- Higher conversion potential

### Cons of Long-Form Content

- Time-consuming to create  
- May not suit mobile readers if not well designed  
- Can be overwhelming without proper formatting

## Should I Use Short-Form or Long-Form Content?

**Ideally, both.** Word count should not dictate your content marketing strategy. Instead, your strategy should determine the appropriate format.

Backlinko’s research highlights that long-form content performs better in search rankings, but this success often reflects **user intent** more than just length.

For example:
- A landing page benefits from short-form content because the reader is ready to act.
- A blog exploring a niche trend may perform better as long-form to address detailed queries.

## Mapping Content to the Sales Funnel

### **Awareness Stage**

- **Short-form**: Social posts, infographics
- **Long-form**: Blog articles, SEO-focused guides to build brand visibility

### **Consideration Stage**

- **Short-form**: Email campaigns, newsletters
- **Long-form**: Case studies, white papers to build trust and authority

### **Purchase Stage**

- **Short-form**: Follow-up emails, testimonials
- **Long-form**: How-to guides, onboarding documents

## Final Thoughts

A strong B2B content strategy balances both long- and short-form content. Use short-form for engagement and quick hits of value. Use long-form to nurture, educate, and convert. Above all, **let your customer journey and intent lead the way** — not just word count.
