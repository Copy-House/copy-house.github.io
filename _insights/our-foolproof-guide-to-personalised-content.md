# Our Foolproof Guide to Personalised Content

In the world of modern marketing, personalisation is everything. While 43% of customers say they’re more likely to convert after a personalised experience, 64% of marketers believe well-targeted content is their biggest web optimisation challenge.

While it can be a complicated process to get your head around, there are a number of steps you can take to make it much easier — and more effective.

## What is Personalised Content?

Personalised content is a way of creating content for your audience that is unique and relevant to them and their interests. In the B2B world especially, this type of content marketing can be used to provide a better online research and purchase experience, to improve campaign targeting and increase conversion rates.

While many may associate personalised content with B2C, it’s becoming increasingly important in B2B, where buyers also crave relevant, engaging experiences with the brands they work with.

## What Are the Benefits of Using Personalised Content?

### Increasing Conversions

Personalised content helps your audience understand how your offering fits their specific needs. When a company can answer their questions and demonstrate understanding, it builds trust — and increases the likelihood of conversion.

### Improving Brand Awareness

If you're providing valuable, relevant content, your brand is more likely to stick in your audience’s mind. This also increases the chances of being recommended or shared within their network.

### Boosting Brand Engagement

A targeted campaign is far more engaging than a generic one. Personalised emails or articles that arrive at just the right time can capture attention, encourage interaction, and build a deeper relationship with your audience.

### Understanding Your Audience Better

Personalisation requires audience insight. As your campaigns grow, you gather more data, which helps refine your messaging and understand what content works best at different stages of the buyer journey.

---

## Where Do I Start with Personalising Content?

Begin by understanding your audience’s goals, pain points, and decision-making criteria. What challenges do they face? What information will help them succeed?

Start building customer personas, consider different journey stages, and identify the most valuable types of content for each segment.

## Different Ways to Personalise Your Content

### Personalise by Segment

Tailor content to specific industries or roles. For example:  
**“The Best Payment Solutions for FinTech Organisations.”**

### Personalise by Stage

Match content to the buying journey. Nurture leads with relevant resources based on previous engagement or behaviours.

### Personalise by Persona

Craft content that speaks to the goals, fears, and motivations of specific customer types.

### Personalise by Lead

Create bespoke assets for individual leads, addressing their unique questions and helping with the decision-making process.

### Personalise by Account

Target key accounts with unique messaging, landing pages, and proposals. This is especially effective in account-based marketing (ABM) strategies.

## Different Types of Personalised Content

### Blogs and Articles

Use keyword research to understand your audience’s questions, then build out a content plan to provide thoughtful answers. The more relevant and specific your articles are, the more likely they are to rank — and convert.

### Landing Pages

Segment-specific landing pages streamline the user journey and improve conversion. Tailor content, messaging, and CTAs to fit the audience's sector, goals or problems.

### Emails

Add personalisation with names, tailored subject lines, and message content that speaks directly to the recipient’s needs and role.

### Advertising

Target ads to specific audiences based on their online behaviour, platform usage, or previous engagement. A well-timed, personalised ad can significantly outperform generic messaging.
