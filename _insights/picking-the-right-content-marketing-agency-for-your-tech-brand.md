## Have You Picked the Right Content Marketing Agency for Your Tech Brand?

Did you know that content marketing costs 62% less than traditional marketing and generates approximately three times as many leads?

It’s no wonder why 91% of B2B marketers spend time thoroughly researching a content marketing agency that perfectly matches their brand's needs.  
But how do you know whether you’ve picked the right one?  

To help you elevate your technology or FinTech brand, we’ve put together five key features to look out for when selecting a B2B content marketing agency.  

---

### 1. Are They Well-Versed In Your Field?

Technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. So, you need a content marketing agency that keeps its fingers on the pulse of all the latest tech trends.  

Not only do they need to understand technology deeply, but the best agencies also have copywriters who can turn complex, jargon-heavy subjects into digestible and informative content for anyone to understand.  

This becomes especially important if your audience isn’t particularly tech-savvy.

### 2. Are They SEO Experts?

Did you know that the first five results on a search engine results page (SERP) receive **67.6%** of clicks?

You could have the most brilliantly written and designed content, but if no one sees it, it won’t deliver value.  
SEO enables your content to rank higher on Google, so your audience sees your brand when they’re searching for relevant solutions.

With **84%** of B2B businesses already investing in content marketing, standing out organically is increasingly difficult.  
You need SEO experts that can bring your content strategy to life and get it seen by the right audience.

### 3. Do They Harmonise Copy and Design?

The average user spends **10 to 20 seconds** on a page before losing interest.  
To keep them engaged, your content needs to combine strong copy with visual storytelling.

Visual assets are especially valuable in the tech and FinTech space, where concepts can be complex. Great design breaks down difficult content and ensures key information stands out.

> “We noticed early on that sourcing design to an external company ruined the seamless flow of the content. So, we introduced a content design service and ensured our designers and copywriters were constantly communicating throughout a project.”  
> — *Kathryn Strachan, Managing Director of CopyHouse*

According to research, people remember **65%** of content paired with visuals three days later, versus just **10%** without them.

But design must be purposeful — if done wrong, it can overshadow your message. Look for agencies that integrate design and content from the beginning of a project.

### 4. Do They Have Proven Results?

Would you purchase a product without reading the reviews?

Reputable agencies should be able to showcase:

- Client case studies  
- Tangible results  
- Testimonials  

When reviewing case studies, ask yourself:

- Do their clients have similar challenges to mine?  
- What results did they achieve?  
- Can they replicate that success for my business?

You can also check independent reviews on platforms like [Google](https://www.google.com) or [Clutch](https://clutch.co).

### 5. Do They Focus on Your Audience?

A customer-centric strategy is no longer optional — it’s essential.

The right content marketing agency will go beyond surface-level demographics to build detailed personas. They’ll help you identify:

- Your customer's pain points  
- The content formats and topics that resonate  
- The tone of voice that builds trust  

Agencies that co-create customer avatars with you are better equipped to deliver targeted, effective campaigns that drive results.
