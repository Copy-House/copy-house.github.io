Across the modern business landscape, sustainability objectives have become an issue of primary commercial and ethical concern; not just to society at large, but also to large-scale global enterprises — especially those in the tech sector. The importance of sustainability is evidenced by the way the topic is now treated by the industry as a benchmark for its success. Indeed, research by Gartner has found that the issue of sustainability traverses all strategic technology trends for 2023, and that 50% of CIOs will have performance metrics tied to the sustainability of their IT organisation by 2025.

A great many tech and IT businesses are now fully aware that their products and services can contribute towards mitigating the climate emergency as well as drive new commercial revenue opportunities. However, there are plenty of obstacles facing organisations who want to achieve their laudable sustainability goals, and making meaningful change at corporate level is an activity fraught with any number of complex interdependencies. It first requires a combination of tech, data and changing behaviours.

## Tech and the Environment

Before we proceed, we have to acknowledge that the tech and IT industries can be especially damaging to the environment.

Modern technology, particularly digital tech, is highly dependent on fossil fuels and rare earth minerals. Hardware is composed of plastic and mined materials like copper and zinc. The environmental toll includes deforestation, carbon emissions, and increasing levels of e-waste — forecasted to reach 120 million tonnes annually by 2050.

Data centres alone are estimated to account for up to 3% of global electricity usage today, projected to rise to 4% by 2030. Software also has a hidden environmental cost due to the power required to support global-scale infrastructure.

## A Matter of Metrics

One of the major obstacles to achieving sustainability goals is measurement itself. While initiatives like COP, the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal have begun to standardise ESG metrics, implementation still varies.

Bernard Lebelle, CEO of *The Green Link*, explains:  
> “It’s easier to calculate the carbon footprint that you have as an entire company… But if you’re a SaaS company, your actual user activity varies — and that’s harder to track.”

Crucially, Bernard cautions against tokenistic efforts — such as offsetting emissions by planting trees while continuing unsustainable practices. True change comes from engaging every stakeholder in defining and owning sustainability goals.

## Making Meaningful Change

To drive real progress, tech businesses must go beyond compliance and take strategic action:

- **Adopt sustainable SaaS solutions**  
These tools help track carbon output, reduce waste, and streamline processes while improving efficiency.

- **Invest in renewables and traceability tools**  
New technologies offer better ways to monitor and reduce your environmental footprint.

- **Recycle e-waste**  
Less than 20% of e-waste is currently recycled, despite the high potential for recovering valuable materials.

- **Join industry initiatives**  
Partnerships like the Climate Savers Computing Initiative offer frameworks and accountability.

### Culture Change Starts at the Top

Matthew Robinson, a strategic ESG advisor, adds:  
> “Many organisations throw money at the problem, or write a strategy, without fundamentally understanding how they operate day to day.”

For sustainability to work, every employee must understand how their actions affect the environment. CSOs must act as educators and bridge-builders, engaging colleagues, suppliers, and customers alike.

### In Summary

Sustainability is no longer optional — it's a business imperative. Organisations that embrace meaningful metrics and educate their workforce will not only reduce environmental impact but also build a more resilient, purpose-driven brand.
