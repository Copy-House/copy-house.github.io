> “Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity.” – Charles Mingus.

Many B2B marketers ask themselves the common question: **How do I make my marketing messages simple and resonant to draw in new audiences?**

The answer is to distill complex ideas into their core essence and communicate them in clear, relatable terms.

This article will explore the art of simplifying complex topics to help B2B brands ditch the jargon and frame marketing messages into compelling, actionable solutions.

## Understanding your audience's knowledge level and needs

Audience research is the cornerstone of any great content strategy. Understanding your core customer base and what makes them tick is the first step in tailoring content marketing strategies to address their pain points and build trust in your brand.

A recent survey revealed that **47% of marketers** agree that audience research is the top contributing factor to the success of their content marketing campaigns.

Conducting surveys, focus groups, and using social listening tools will help you identify audience segments and discover the industry talking points that matter most to them.

Additionally, carefully consider the level of knowledge each segment has about your chosen topics. CFOs, for example, will have separate priorities from CTOs and approach complex subjects differently. Ultimately, you wouldn't waste your time reading about a topic you know inside out, so make sure you understand who would find your basic 'how to' article useful and who would instead want to explore the 'why' of the topic in hand.

## Gather your information sources and evaluate the content

Content marketers approach subject research differently; there's no one-size-fits-all approach to gathering information sources.

For instance, some marketers will start thinking about the end product and the feelings they want to elicit in the reader when they encounter the campaign. From there, they will 'reverse engineer' the structure and arguments of the final piece, incorporating just the information they need to create the desired outcome.

Alternatively, content marketers can research extensively, gathering relevant information from various sources, evaluating it, and crafting the ideal piece of content based on what they have learned.

The key takeaway from both approaches is to organise the information you need to explore your complex topic effectively. Be discerning about the research rabbit holes you go down to ensure that every informational tidbit you find contributes to your main message.

## Storytelling technique to make your content narrative compelling

Deploying storytelling techniques is the best way to attract and maintain your audience's attention as you guide them through the ins and outs of your content journey.

Here are a few classic storytelling techniques to help you craft a compelling brand narrative:

- **The Hero's Journey**: Set up the brand or reader as the protagonist, overcoming challenges with your solution and returning wiser.
- **Sparklines**: Contrast the current situation with an improved future state. Think Martin Luther King's “I Have a Dream” speech.
- **In Medias Res**: Drop the audience into the middle of the action, then explain how you got there.
- **The Petal Structure**: Organise multiple related narratives around one theme, offering multiple perspectives that converge on a core message.

## Speaking your audience's language and avoiding jargon

Choosing keywords thoughtfully forms the bridge connecting complex subjects to your audience's understanding and search intent.

According to Ahrefs, **96.55% of web pages receive no organic traffic** because they don't include keywords in the title, meta description, and on-page copy.

Using tools like **SEMrush**, you can uncover the language your audience uses to describe their problems and tailor your content accordingly.

The use of jargon depends on context. If your audience uses industry terms regularly, incorporating them with clear explanations can enhance credibility. But if those terms are niche or ambiguous, plain language will go further in building trust.

## The medium is the message

“The medium is the message” is a concept that reminds us the **form** of communication influences how the **message** is received.

For complex subjects, exploring **visual formats** such as explainer videos or infographics can make abstract ideas more digestible.

Long-form content still has its place — especially when it’s structured with bullet summaries, bold key points, and clear calls to action that show readers exactly what to do next.
