# The future of remote working

When the pandemic struck in 2020, thousands of businesses went remote, ushering in a new era of flexible work. Today, **74% of professionals expect remote work to be the new norm**.

Even as the world returns to post-lockdown rhythms, **97% of employees want to continue working remotely** or adopt a hybrid schedule ‚Äî a clear indication that expectations have shifted permanently.

## Why remote working jobs are the future

Before COVID-19, remote work was a niche arrangement. Only 14% of people worked remotely, often stifled by ingrained workplace norms.

But the pandemic changed everything ‚Äî rapidly pushing businesses to digitise communications and issue remote tools. As a result, **56% of professionals now work remotely**.

Remote work has proven a win-win for the **planet**, **people**, and **businesses** alike.

## üåç The planet

Global CO2 emissions fell during lockdowns as commuting stopped and offices closed. Less energy consumption meant a meaningful reduction in environmental impact ‚Äî a long-overdue step in the right direction.

## üë• The people

Remote work gives people back their most valuable resource: **time**. Whether used for fitness, family, or travel, flexible schedules empower employees to live more balanced lives.

- Employees can work from anywhere ‚Äî staying connected with loved ones abroad.
- 40% of workers say they‚Äôd quit their jobs rather than return to the office.

It‚Äôs clear that freedom and flexibility have become core employee expectations.

## üíº The business

Remote working enhances **productivity**, boosts **employee morale**, and improves **retention**. It also expands access to global talent pools ‚Äî allowing businesses to hire based on **skills**, not location.

This also benefits business customers. Competing globally requires scalable, tech-savvy teams ‚Äî something remote-first operations are built for.

## How CopyHouse has championed remote working

Like many, CopyHouse went remote in 2020 ‚Äî but we decided to go further. We introduced a **work-from-anywhere policy**, allowing our team to work from anywhere in the world, anytime ‚Äî as long as deadlines and calls are met.

With team members based in the **USA, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Portugal** and beyond, remote work helped our people:

- Stay close to family
- Work when they feel most creative
- Preserve mental health

We supported this by launching:

- **Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)**: Monthly sessions with a mental wellbeing coach.
- **Trickle**: A platform for anonymous feedback, success sharing and open communication.
- **Virtual socials & meetups**: Regular online and in-person events to keep our team connected.

## Taking over Europe

With rapid growth came global ambitions. That‚Äôs why we launched **CopyHouse Europe** to:

- Improve service to EU clients  
- Expand our European client base  
- Recruit exceptional talent across the continent  

But Brexit made hiring abroad tricky ‚Äî until we partnered with **Remote**.

**Remote** is a global employment platform launched in 2019 that helps companies hire talent internationally without legal headaches.

They manage:

- Local employment compliance
