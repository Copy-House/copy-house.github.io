# The Ultimate Guide to Choosing a Content Marketing Agency in 2024

The business landscape is in a state of flux, and 2024 is bringing senior leaders new challenges to overcome. With venture capital low and inflation rates high, there’s a considerable squeeze on growth opportunities — and that’s to say nothing of other common pressures that business leaders face; time management, people management, compliance, AI, sales and so on…

Luckily, the right agency partner can help. Offering timely support, flexible resources and reliable delivery timelines, it’s no wonder then how they can supercharge your growth. The only problem? How to find the right one.

In this comprehensive guide, we’re outlining how you can identify the right content marketing agency and more. We’ll briefly examine what exactly content marketing is as well as the dual opportunities and hurdles it presents — and how you can adapt to each with a trusty content marketing agency.

## In Brief: What is Content Marketing?

Content marketing is the process of creating and distributing interesting, relevant and thoughtful content. As an inbound marketing strategy, the aim is to attract, engage, and retain your target audience rather than pester them with cold calls, emails or poorly targeted flyers that often lack the level of insight, accuracy or support people are looking for.

Content marketing typically focuses on digital channels like websites, social media and email marketing. Assets include blogs, ebooks, whitepapers, newsletters, videos, podcasts and more. Offline channels like print media and live seminars can also play a role.

## Why is Content Marketing Important?

There are several reasons why content marketing is a cornerstone of modern strategy:

- **Brand awareness:** Improve your visibility through SEO, social and consistent value-led content.
- **Conversion:** Solve real problems for your audience — brands with blogs generate 67% more leads than those without.
- **Thought leadership:** Share deep expertise to position your brand as a credible, go-to authority.
- **Customer loyalty:** Nurture long-term engagement by consistently addressing evolving customer needs.
- **Supports other strategies:** Great content fuels SEO, email, and social strategies with better-targeted messaging.

## What Drives Businesses Towards Agencies?

### Problems With Content Marketing Specifically

Content marketing has many moving parts — from strategy to execution. That’s why many businesses turn to external agency support.

For instance, Meta approached CopyHouse for support with a flagship whitepaper on brand suitability. Initially scoped at 3,000 words, it expanded to 5,000 — delivered on time and in full.

Other examples include:
- Klarna: Case studies and open banking guides
- VizLib: Nearly 150,000 words of content across 90 deliverables
- Atech: Full SEO-led website redesign plus ongoing content production

Agencies offer flexible support for ad hoc projects or long-term retainers — tailored to your resource gaps and marketing goals.

### Where Else Agencies Can Help

Beyond content creation, agencies often provide:
- Strategic planning
- UX audits
- SEO and keyword strategy
- Branding and design workshops

Agencies can be a plug-in partner or lead your efforts entirely, depending on your structure.

## How to Choose a Content Marketing Agency in 2024

### The Basics

**1. A High Quality and Diverse Mix of Content**  
Review their portfolio — not just for writing quality, but breadth. Look for blogs, guides, infographics, videos and more.

**2. Content Strategy Expertise**  
Follow their public channels. How do they structure their posts? What’s their SEO game? How are they engaging followers? Don’t be afraid to ask them how they measure success.

**3. Flexibility and Scalability**  
A great agency handles changes, urgent rebriefs and feedback loops without disruption. They should scale with your needs and integrate well with internal and external teams.

---

### Added Value Drivers

**Industry Understanding**  
If your brand operates in complex sectors like tech or finance, deep industry expertise is essential. At CopyHouse, for example, we understand the regulatory, technical and audience nuances of sectors from fintech to cybersecurity.

**Robust Communication and Transparency**  
You should expect:
- Clear pricing
- Defined scope and delivery timelines
- Regular updates and outcome reporting

A good agency keeps you informed and aligns with your goals.
