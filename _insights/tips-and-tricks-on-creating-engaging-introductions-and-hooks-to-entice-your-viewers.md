# Tips and Tricks on Creating Engaging Introductions and Hooks to Entice Your Viewers

Did you know, **55% of visitors spend 15 seconds or less on a site**? So if your intro doesn’t grab their attention in those 15 seconds, you’ve lost a potential lead.

With millions of blogs posted daily, companies are fighting for the attention of their web visitors, users and readers. Unfortunately, there’s only so much information that can be shared before it becomes repetitive and boring.

So how can you keep your audience engaged through writing captivating introductions and brilliant hooks? In this blog, we’ll share the proven CopyHouse formula for hooks that will grab your audience’s attention!

## Creating Engaging Introductions

The purpose of an introduction is to immediately capture the attention of your reader. Often readers want information fast and straight to the point. That’s why your introduction must show them that this is the right place to obtain whatever they’re after.

An example of a good introduction is:

> *[Example omitted—consider adding your actual intro example here]*

**What makes this a good introduction:**

- It's short and concise – great for skim reading.
- It starts with an enticing hook.
- It sets the scene clearly.
- It uses "you" to personalise the message.
- It avoids fluff – short and snappy.
- It addresses the reader’s intent immediately.
- It ends with a clear sentence outlining what the article will explore.

## Length of the Intro

Although there’s no fixed rule, intros should match attention spans. For a 1,000-word article, aim for **3–4 small paragraphs** (5–6 sentences or ~125–200 words).

---

## Get Straight to Your Point

Avoid fluff. Readers need a simple, clear message—**what’s in it for them**. If the point clicks in 3 seconds, they’ll read on. If it’s vague, they’ll bounce.

---

## Personalise Your Intro

### Make it Relatable

Know your audience. They need to *see themselves* in your content. Make it relevant and valuable to their world.

### Speak Directly to the Reader

Use the word **“you”** naturally and often. It makes the writing empathetic and relevant.

### Make it Human

Appeal to emotion. Help the reader see the possibilities and opportunities your content offers. Reassure them this will be worth their time.

## How to Make Your Content Pop

### Take a Stand

Don’t sit on the fence. Be assertive about your opinion or insight—especially on a trending or niche topic. Unclear or neutral intros are easy to skip.

## Creating a Good Hook

In copywriting, a **hook** is an idea or phrase that **draws readers in immediately**. But remember: *don’t promise what you can’t deliver.*

### Types of Hooks:

#### Question Hook

Pose a question that triggers curiosity or reflection.  
**Example:**  
*“Did you know…”*

#### Statistic Hook

Shock the reader with a compelling fact.  
**Example:**  
*“The Economics Times found that only 8% of the world's currency is physical.”*

#### Anecdotal Hook

Use a meaningful quote or real-life insight.  
**Example:**  
*“Client X went above and beyond to ensure we achieved our goals in the short space of 6 months.”*

## Power of a Story

Sparking imagination draws the reader into the journey. Use narrative hooks like:

### Introduce a Relatable Protagonist

The protagonist should mirror your target audience—someone they can relate to.

### Set the Scene

World-build within their reality. The content should feel familiar and achievable.

### A Call to Adventure

Outline the challenge and end goal—what’s the transformation you’ll help them achieve?

---

## Research Enhances Credibility

If you have a compelling stat, **use it**—don’t bury it in fluff. Facts show authority, build trust and justify the reader’s time.

---

## What to Avoid!

Even with the best intentions, bad introductions drive readers away. Avoid:

- Vague, filler sentences
- Irrelevant tangents
- Weak topic setup
- No clear message or purpose
- No audience connection
- Info overload
- Cringey clichés
- Strawman arguments
- Overpromising
- Too many external links (max one, not in the first line)
- Most importantly: **don’t be boring**

With these tips in hand, you’re ready to write introductions and hooks that keep your readers locked in from the first sentence.
