# Top Tips For Generating B2B Leads Through Social Media

Social media is one of the most powerful tools in your marketing department’s toolkit. But, when it comes to lead generation, your sales team should be using it too.

Generating leads in the B2B market can be tough. First, you need to have a well-practised and researched approach when speaking to potential clients. Second, you must ensure you communicate via a channel your lead is comfortable using and uses frequently.

In the digital era, one of the best channels for lead generation is social media. This article will guide you through the best B2B social media platforms, and explain some B2B social media best practices.

## Best B2B Social Media Platforms

### LinkedIn

Seeing LinkedIn at the top of our list should come as no surprise. The website connects millions of companies and professionals, making it a great place to start business conversations and approach potential clients. According to the Content Marketing Institute, 93% of businesses use LinkedIn for content distribution.

When it comes to B2B lead generation, LinkedIn offers built-in lead generation forms. These allow ads to redirect users directly to a pre-filled signup form — removing the need to design a separate landing page.

This pre-filled format increases convenience, which is crucial. If potential clients find it difficult to get in touch, they’ll lose interest. So, it’s important to make things as easy as possible.

### Twitter

Twitter is another major social media platform, and 66% of users have discovered a business they now frequent through the platform.

For B2B lead generation, Twitter is best used to highlight timely updates. Share new developments, product launches, or promotions, and always include a simple, clear call to action to encourage contact or conversion.

### Facebook

Facebook’s value lies in its sheer user base — 2.9 billion monthly active users as of the end of 2021.

Its real power for B2B lead generation, though, is **Facebook Ads**. Like LinkedIn, Facebook enables advertisers to set up pre-filled registration forms. However, it also provides granular audience targeting — including behaviours, interests, and demographic data — plus robust ad performance analytics.

## B2B Social Media Best Practices

### Prioritise Original Content

Sharing partner or client content is fine occasionally, but to truly generate leads, your posts should add original value.

Reduce the volume of generic updates and focus on creating fewer, higher-impact posts. One great post that drives engagement and conversions is more valuable than daily low-performing ones.

### Keep an Eye on Your Competitors

Social media is not just a broadcast tool — it's also a research asset. Use it to monitor your competitors.

What are they posting? Which demographics are they targeting? This insight helps you differentiate your content and stay competitive — or pivot your efforts where competitors are inactive.

### Don’t Forget Multimedia

If your B2B social strategy relies only on text, you're missing opportunities.

Use **videos**, **photos**, and **interactive media** to capture attention and keep audiences engaged. These formats not only increase visibility but also communicate value faster and more memorably than plain text.
