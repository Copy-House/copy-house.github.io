# Why Is Personal Branding Important for Tech Businesses?

In a world where innovation in technology is accelerating, marketing for tech companies sometimes takes extra effort to help a brand stand out. Personal branding could be the perfect solution to give your marketing efforts an extra push.

A personal brand creates a brand identity for a person, often representing a company. Creating a personal brand helps ensure that your target audience knows who you are, what you stand for, and why prospects should choose you over a competitor.

However, personal branding isn’t all about your business but also about standing for yourself to command confidence and respect from your customers and peers.

This blog will discuss the benefits of creating a personal brand for your tech business and provide a step-by-step guide to help you develop one for yourself.

## Benefits of Personal Branding for Your Tech Brand

### Build Credibility

It’s a known fact that people trust people over brands. In fact, consumers are almost 3x more likely to consider a brand that shows personal value more than business value. A personal brand helps increase the level of trust and deepen the connection between your business and your customers.

### Show Off Your Specialties

Establishing your expert profile or image is often challenging as a corporate brand since customers tend to view businesses as faceless entities — unless your business brand has a compelling, humanised brand personality.

A personal brand allows you to demonstrate your expertise and convince prospects that your company is worth investing in.

### Connect with Your Target Audience

Since people trust people over companies, personal brands also help prospective clients connect with your brand faster. You can also use your personal brand to connect and engage with key stakeholders, influencers, mentors, and decision-makers.

### Support Your Business Brand

A personal brand is excellent for supporting your business brand and emphasising the uniqueness of your company. Personal branding enables you to humanise your brand through key brand-building aspects, such as brand positioning, purpose, vision, personality, mission, values, and story.

## How to Create a Personal Brand for Your Tech Business

### Step 1: Determine Your Goal

First, decide what you want to achieve with your personal brand. Knowing your objectives is important to help focus the posts and content you’ll craft later.

We recommend writing down five goals you hope your personal brand will help you achieve.

### Step 2: Define Your Target Audience

Do you know who you want to connect and engage with via your personal brand? If not, the next step is to decide who you want to target.

Authenticity is crucial in a personal brand. However, while you want to be yourself, producing content that your target audience finds relevant is equally important. Take time to understand your audience’s needs and values and identify where they match what you can offer.

### Step 3: Assess Your Areas of Expertise

For your personal brand to succeed, it’s important to showcase the expertise that your audience needs. In other words, sell something that people want. Determine what you can teach your audience that will help build credibility for you and your business.

In the early stages, focus on giving away knowledge for free. Once you gain momentum and reputation, you can host webinars, courses and other paid events.

### Step 4: Clean Up Your Social Media Accounts

Social media marketing for tech companies relies heavily on LinkedIn. Your audience will research you there to learn about your skills before deciding to work with, hire or refer you.

Make sure your profile has:

- A high-quality, professional picture  
- A banner that represents your company  
- A compelling headline that explains what you do  
- A gripping summary and positioning statement

If you prefer to use more than one platform, Twitter is your next best bet.

### Step 5: Optimise for SEO

There’s no use in creating a stunning profile if no one sees it. So, optimise your social channels for SEO (search engine optimisation).

Include relevant keywords or phrases your audience might search for, such as:

- Insurtech provider  
- Blockchain expert  
- Telehealth consultant  
- [Your Company Name]  

Incorporate these naturally into your LinkedIn profile, Twitter bio, blog, and other touchpoints. Avoid overstuffing to preserve readability and SEO score.

### Step 6: Create a Consistent Posting Schedule

Once your personal brand is in place, publish content that reflects your knowledge and adds value.

Ways to share your expertise:

- Post thoughts on workplace or industry trends  
- Write articles on relevant advice, insights or personal stories  
- Comment thoughtfully on posts and reshare content with insights  

Consistency is key. Don’t post for two weeks and then vanish for a month — it will hurt your credibility. Create a simple calendar of post ideas and set a realistic rhythm, like:

- 1 article every two weeks  
- 3 social posts per week  
- 1 comment per day
