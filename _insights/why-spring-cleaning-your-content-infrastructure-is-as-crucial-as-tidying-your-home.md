# Why Cleaning Your Content Infrastructure is as Crucial as Tidying Your Home

With spring arriving, it’s time for a clean-up — and we don’t just mean your home. Did you know that **cleaning up your content can triple your site traffic**?

Google’s mission is “to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” That’s why **SEO** (Search Engine Optimisation) partly depends on the **quality** and **value** of the information on your website. Outdated, irrelevant, or poorly written content could damage your **online reputation** and lower your rankings.

In this article, we’ll explore why conducting a **content audit** is essential and how to tidy up your digital house for better results.

## Why a Content Audit Matters

Performing a content audit helps you:

- Identify outdated content and refresh it
- Uncover high-performing trends
- Fill content gaps with fresh ideas
- Consolidate underperforming pieces
- Delete content that no longer serves your goals
- Improve overall **user experience** and **SEO visibility**

Google rewards websites that are **well-structured**, **user-friendly**, and **authoritative**. Regular audits help you meet all three criteria.

## When Should You Audit Your Content?

Just like cleaning your home, it depends on the size of your site:

- **Large websites**: Conduct rolling audits monthly by section.
- **Smaller websites**: Audit your entire site every 6 months or do quarterly check-ins by content type.

## Step-by-Step: How to Conduct a Content Audit

### Step 1: Define Your Business Goals & Metrics

Start with questions like:

- What are our top content goals this year?
- Are we focusing on **traffic**, **engagement**, or **conversion**?

Then identify supporting metrics such as:

- **Bounce rate**
- **Time on site**
- **Page visits**
- **Lead generation**

### Step 2: Crawl Your Content

Use content crawlers to pull a comprehensive list of your content, including metadata. Tools we recommend:

- [Screaming Frog SEO Spider](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/)
- [SEMrush Site Audit](https://www.semrush.com/siteaudit/)
- [DeepCrawl](https://www.deepcrawl.com/)
- [OnCrawl](https://www.oncrawl.com/)
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (for advanced users)

Track in a spreadsheet using **Google Analytics** data to capture:

- URL
- Page title
- Content type (e.g., blog, case study)
- Word count
- Publication date
- Page visits
- Avg. time on page
- Conversion rate

### Step 3: Grade and Categorise Your Content

Assign content into four categories:

- **Keep**: Still relevant and performing well.
- **Remove**: Outdated, off-brand, or irrelevant.
- **Consolidate**: Merge similar posts to avoid keyword cannibalisation.
- **Improve**: Content with potential — update with fresh data or formatting.

Tip: Use a 1–5 grading system based on how well each piece hits your key metrics. Define what each number means to ensure consistency.
