Did you know that **91% of online consumers** look at a product review before making a purchase?

A case study tells a story of how you understood the client’s pain points and business problems — and how your product provided solutions to overcome them. In other words, a case study is a glowing product or service review with structure, credibility, and strategy.

Case studies are an excellent way to nurture client relationships and drive conversions. According to The Chartered Management Institute, **case studies are one of the best converting tools of content** — second only to in-person events, which are often more expensive and, due to recent global events, more restrictive.

Join us as we explore the value of case studies and share some actionable tips to help you write ones that convert prospects into clients.

## Build a Connection with Prospective Clients

You already know that you’re great at what you do — but your audience needs proof.

While your target audience may understand their pain points, it’s your job to demonstrate that **your solution fits**.

Case studies let you share success in a relatable way. People are far more likely to trust their peers than brands. In fact, **91% of consumers rate online reviews** almost on par with recommendations from friends and family.

By showing how your product or service has solved a challenge for someone in a similar position, case studies reduce perceived risk and build **trust and confidence**. Done well, they’re often the final nudge needed to convert a warm lead into a signed client.

## Case Studies Are Your Portfolio of Proof

An up-to-date, well-structured library of case studies is your **secret sales asset**.

Every project you complete is another opportunity to show potential customers that you can solve their problems. A solid portfolio of case studies means you’re never without real-world proof of your capabilities — shareable, scannable and conversion-focused.

## Best Practices for Writing Case Studies

### 1. Follow a Narrative

A case study should tell a story, sound professional and leave no questions unanswered. We recommend a clear, four-part structure:

- **Introduction**: Who is the client? What industry are they in?
- **Challenge**: What problems were they facing?
- **Solution**: What product/service did you deliver, and how?
- **Results**: What changed? Use clear metrics and testimonials.

### 2. Use Interviews

Start by getting the client’s permission. Then, focus on their perspective — not your internal wins.

Gather their input via interview, ideally led by someone not directly involved in delivery. This encourages honest, open feedback. You’ll capture better quotes and uncover insights you may have missed.

**Top tip**: record the interview. You’ll be able to pull key quotes and messages more accurately.

### 3. Keep It Concise

Your case study should have *just enough* detail to build confidence and convert. No fluff, no filler.

Stick to a clear narrative and pull out a few standout quotes. Aim for **under 1,000 words**, broken into short, skimmable sections with clear subheadings. This improves readability and positions you as a clear, confident expert.

### 4. Make It Easy to Find

Don’t bury your case studies in a submenu. Add them to your **main navigation**, homepage, and link to them in relevant blog posts and landing pages.

Always include a **call to action** at the end — whether that’s downloading a PDF, submitting a contact form, or scheduling a call. Your case study should not only inspire confidence but also spark action.

## Turn Case Studies Into Lead Generators

When done right, case studies are one of the most **persuasive forms of content** in your marketing toolkit.

They combine the credibility of social proof with the structure of a sales pitch — all in a format that’s accessible and engaging.
