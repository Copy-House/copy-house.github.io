## Guide to Leveraging Data Analytics for Advanced Segmentation in Tech

Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all marketing. Today's consumers have instant access to every tech product and service on the planet. So, to thrive in this hyper-competitive industry, tech marketers must redefine how they find and speak to their potential customers by making interactions utterly unique and conversion-focused. 

**Advanced segmentation** is a vital first step in helping tech brands personalise customer journeys and bolster the success of their marketing efforts. 

This article will explore how the latest data analytics tools can help you seamlessly incorporate advanced market segmentation into your marketing strategies and tailor every customer interaction.

## What is advanced segmentation?

Customer segmentation is the practice of splitting audiences into clearly defined groups based on shared characteristics such as gender, age, and location. **Advanced market segmentation** goes beyond these traditional categories, deploying data analytics to provide more insights into customer behaviours and characteristics such as customer lifetime value, churn risk and satisfaction levels. 

For example, advanced segmentation can be used to develop targeted email campaigns based on purchase history or deliver product recommendations based on a user's previous site interactions.

Within the tech sector specifically, research by Foundry revealed that **96% of IT decision-makers** are interested in content that reflects the needs of their industry, IT infrastructure, and company size. Yet, only around **two-thirds** of tech marketers feel they successfully create this type of tailored content.

That’s a missed opportunity, considering **80% of companies** using segmentation report increased sales — sometimes by up to **50%** in conversion rates.

## Four characteristics of tech brands embracing advanced segmentation

### 1. **Uniqueness**

Tech products aren’t restricted by borders — if the solution is good, it can sell globally. With so much competition, tech brands must double down on what makes them different. Advanced segmentation helps you fine-tune messaging that speaks directly to unique user groups and creates lasting resonance.

### 2. **Simplicity**

Tech products are complex, which means trying to explain every feature in one go isn’t practical. Instead, segmentation helps marketers **tailor benefits** to the individual, delivering relevant information based on that audience’s preferences and expectations.

It also **optimises resource allocation**, ensuring that marketing teams spend their time and budget on the most promising segments.

### 3. **Resonance**

Not all customers fit into neat demographic boxes. You need to develop empathy for changing user needs. Advanced segmentation offers granular insights — such as friction points in software — that enable you to adjust communications or offers in real time.

### 4. **Responsiveness**

Tech evolves rapidly. With **generative AI**, **automation**, and other tools shaping user behaviour, marketing must be agile.

Advanced segmentation allows for **real-time responsiveness** — like automatically tailoring landing pages based on visitor behaviour or industry — boosting engagement and conversions.

CDPs like **Oracle Unity** or **Adobe Experience Platform** consolidate customer data in real time and apply AI and machine learning to deliver a **360-degree customer view**.

This unified customer perspective enables better governance and deeper segmentation for more accurate messaging and targeting.

### Predictive Analytics

Tools like **Microsoft Power BI** unlock powerful capabilities including:

- **Propensity modelling** – Predict customer lifetime value.
- **Basket analysis** – Identify cross-sell/upsell opportunities.
- **Churn risk assessment** – Intervene before customers drop off.
- **Sentiment analysis** – Understand emotional reactions to products or services.
- **Custom segmentation** – Create tailored models based on usage, adoption or feature engagement.

### Hyper-personalisation

Platforms like **Dynamic Yield** use AI-driven DCO (Dynamic Content Optimisation) and OMA (Omnichannel Marketing Automation) to serve content that aligns with customer behaviour and preferences in real time.

Hyper-personalisation can act like a digital concierge — delivering the **right whitepaper, offer, or CTA** before your customer even asks.
